- [Rock The Steps](https://github.com/openforge/rock-the-steps-app)
- [OpenFarm](https://github.com/openforge/openfarm-puzzle-game)

# Getting Started

## Install

```bash
npm install @openforge/capacitor-game-connect
npx cap sync
```

## Additional Code Setup

## Android

In order to use the plugin, you need to make sure to include this meta-data tag in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file of your app:

```xml
<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.games.APP_ID" android:value="@string/game_services_project_id"/>
```

Then you need to set your Game Services Project ID in your `strings.xml` file inside your `app/src/main/res/values.xml`:

```xml
<string translatable="false"  name="game_services_project_id">YOU_APP_ID</string>
```

- Then on your `MainActivity.class` file you will need to import and register the plugin in your onCreate method:

```ts
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    registerPlugin(CapacitorGameConnectPlugin.class);
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
}
```
