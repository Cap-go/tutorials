# capacitor-power-mode-extended

The [`power-mode`](https://github.com/AdlerJS/power-mode) Capacitor plugin is forked. In addition to detecting power-saving mode, it can be used to go to the battery settings screen.

## Install

You need @capacitor/core@^6.0.0

```bash
npm install capacitor-power-mode-extended
npx cap sync
```

## Usage
```js
import { registerPlugin } from '@capacitor/core'

export const PowerMode = registerPlugin("PowerModeExtended");

// Returns the status of power saving mode
PowerMode.lowPowerMode()
.then(data => {
    // It is displayed as { lowPowerModeEnabled: true/false }
    console.log(data)
})

// Open the battery settings window.
// â€»iOS does not recommend going directly to the battery settings screen, so jump to the settings home screen.
PowerMode.openPowerSettings()
```
