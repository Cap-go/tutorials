# Capacitor Foreground Service Plugin

## A simple foreground service manager

#### NOTICE: Using this plugin alone will not enable users to use JavaScript when an application is running in the background.

#### A second plugin that generates a background process to offer the program background cycles must be used in conjunction with this.

#### The primary purpose of this plugin is to address the issue mentioned above. If an app is not deemed a "foreground app" for Android API 26 or later, background processing will be prohibited, and background pluggins won't operate as intended.

### With the help of this plugin, your application will operate correctly in the background by becoming a forefront program. This plugin could also be useful for Android Doze, which prevents applications from running in the background unless they are also running in the forefront.

### Compatible with android ApiVersions >= 26

## Usage

# Start service

Arguments:

```ts
interface StartServiceOptions {
  title: string
  description: string
  icon?: string // Custom icon path otherwise a Star icon is the default

  //default: NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_LOW;
  notificationId?: number // custom notificationId
}
