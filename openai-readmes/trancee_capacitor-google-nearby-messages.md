# Nearby Messages

The Nearby Messages API is a publish-subscribe API that lets you pass small binary payloads between internet-connected Android and iOS devices. The devices don't have to be on the same network, but they do have to be connected to the Internet.

Nearby uses a combination of Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi and near-ultrasonic audio to communicate a unique-in-time pairing code between devices. The server facilitates message exchange between devices that detect the same pairing code. When a device detects a pairing code from a nearby device, it sends the pairing code to the Nearby Messages server for validation, and to check whether there are any messages to deliver for the applicationâ€™s current set of subscriptions.

## Android

To use the Nearby Messages APIs, you need a [Google Account](https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/index.html). This is so that you, the developer, can enable the Nearby API in the next step (your users will not need to have a Google account). If you already have an account, then you're all set. You may also want a separate Google Account for testing purposes.

Get an API key, then configure your manifest with the API Key generated:

```java
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.google.sample.app" >
    <application ...>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.nearby.messages.API_KEY"
            android:value="API_KEY" />
        <activity>
        ...
        </activity>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

## iOS

To use the Nearby Messages APIs, you need a [Google Account](https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount). If you already have an account, then you're all set. You may also want a separate Google Account for testing purposes.

Get an API key, then pass it as the _apiKey_ argument in the `initialize` method.
