# Using the Provisioning-Test Package

## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using the Provisioning-Test package with Capacitor. The Provisioning-Test package is a useful tool for testing the provisioning of your application and ensuring that it works as expected in different environments.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have the following software installed:

- Capacitor
- Provisioning-Test package

## Steps

1. Install the Provisioning-Test package by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install provisioning-test
```

2. Once the installation is complete, import the Provisioning-Test package into your project:

```javascript
import ProvisioningTest from 'provisioning-test';
```

3. To perform a provisioning test, you can use the `testProvisioning` method provided by the package. Call this method whenever you need to perform a provisioning test:

```javascript
ProvisioningTest.testProvisioning();
```

4. The `testProvisioning` method will simulate a provisioning process and return a promise. You can use this promise to handle the result of the provisioning test:

```javascript
ProvisioningTest.testProvisioning().then(result => {
  // Handle the result of the provisioning test
  console.log(result);
}).catch(error => {
  // Handle any errors that occur during the provisioning test
  console.error(error);
});
```

5. You can customize the provisioning test by passing an options object to the `testProvisioning` method. The options object allows you to specify the test mode, target platform, and other parameters:

```javascript
const options = {
  mode: 'development',
  platform: 'ios',
  // Add any other options as needed
};

ProvisioningTest.testProvisioning(options).then(result => {
  // Handle the result of the provisioning test
  console.log(result);
}).catch(error => {
  // Handle any errors that occur during the provisioning test
  console.error(error);
});
```

6. That's it! You have now successfully used the Provisioning-Test package with Capacitor to perform a provisioning test. Make sure to test your application in different environments to ensure it works as expected.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the Provisioning-Test package with Capacitor to perform a provisioning test. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can ensure that your application is properly provisioned and functions correctly in different environments.
