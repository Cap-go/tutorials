I'm sorry, but I don't have the specific details and content required to generate a markdown tutorial for using the `@silvermaster-gt/capacitor-plugin-meta-analytics` package. You can refer to the documentation provided by the package maintainers for detailed instructions on how to use it. 

For the specific frontmatter values you mentioned, I can provide you with a sample template:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Blog Title"
description: "Summary of the blog content here"
created_at: "2022-01-01"
published: true
slug: "capacitor-plugin-meta-analytics.git"
---
```

You can add this frontmatter at the beginning of your markdown file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual blog details.
