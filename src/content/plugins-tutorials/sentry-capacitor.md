# Using @sentry/capacitor for Error Tracking in Capacitor Apps

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) is a popular error tracking platform that helps developers monitor and fix issues in their applications. With the `@sentry/capacitor` package, you can easily integrate Sentry into your Capacitor apps and track errors and exceptions.

In this tutorial, we'll go through the steps to install and use the `@sentry/capacitor` package in your Capacitor app.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Capacitor CLI installed (`npm install -g @capacitor/cli`)
- A Sentry account. If you don't have one, sign up for free at [https://sentry.io](https://sentry.io/).

## Step 1: Install the Required Packages
Open your project in the terminal and install the `@sentry/capacitor` package along with the `@sentry/angular` package (optional if you're using Angular) by running the following command:

```bash
yarn add @sentry/capacitor @sentry/angular --exact
```

## Step 2: Initialize Sentry
In your app's `app.module.ts` file, import the necessary Sentry modules:

```typescript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/capacitor";
import { init as sentryAngularInit, createErrorHandler }  from "@sentry/angular";
```

Initialize Sentry by calling `Sentry.init` and passing the DSN (Data Source Name) for your Sentry project:

```typescript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "__DSN__",
}, sentryAngularInit);
```

Replace `__DSN__` with your actual DSN. You can find the DSN in your Sentry project settings.

## Step 3: Attach Sentry ErrorHandler
To automatically capture errors and exceptions in your app, attach the Sentry ErrorHandler in your `app.module.ts` file:

```typescript
@NgModule({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: ErrorHandler,
      useValue: createErrorHandler(),
    },
  ],
})
```

## Step 4: Set Context Information
You can set context information that will be attached to error reports. For example, you can set user information, tags, and extras. Here's an example of setting user information:

```typescript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/capacitor';

Sentry.configureScope(scope => {
  scope.setUser({ id: 'user123' });
});
```

You can also set tags and extras using the `setTag` and `setExtra` methods respectively.

## Step 5: Capture Errors and Events
To capture errors, exceptions, or custom events, use the methods provided by `@sentry/capacitor`. Here are a few examples:

```typescript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/capacitor';

// Capture an exception
Sentry.captureException(new Error('Something went wrong'));

// Capture a message
Sentry.captureMessage('Hello, world!');

// Capture a manual event
Sentry.captureEvent({
  message: 'Custom event',
  stacktrace: [
    // ...
  ],
});
```

## Conclusion
That's it! You have successfully integrated Sentry error tracking into your Capacitor app using the `@sentry/capacitor` package. Now, any errors or exceptions that occur in your app will be captured and sent to Sentry for analysis.

Happy error tracking!
