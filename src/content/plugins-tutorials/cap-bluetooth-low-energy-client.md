# Using cap-bluetooth-low-energy-client Package Tutorial

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the cap-bluetooth-low-energy-client package in Capacitor to interact with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices.

## Installation
To get started, install the package using npm:
```bash
npm install cap-bluetooth-low-energy-client
npx cap sync
```

## Connecting to a BLE Device
Before interacting with a BLE device, it's important to establish a connection. Here's how you can do it:

```typescript
import 'cap-bluetooth-low-energy-client';
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { BLE } = Plugins;

// Establishing a connection
BLE.connect({ address: 'device_address' })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Connected to the BLE device');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error connecting to the BLE device: ', error);
  });
```

## Reading Characteristics
Once connected, you can read characteristics from the BLE device:

```typescript
// Reading a characteristic
BLE.readCharacteristic({ address: 'device_address', serviceUUID: 'service_id', characteristicUUID: 'characteristic_id' })
  .then((data) => {
    console.log('Characteristic value: ', data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error reading characteristic: ', error);
  });
```

## Writing to Characteristics
To write data to a characteristic of the BLE device, you can use the following code snippet:

```typescript
// Writing to a characteristic
BLE.writeCharacteristic({ address: 'device_address', serviceUUID: 'service_id', characteristicUUID: 'characteristic_id', value: 'your_data_to_write' })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Data written successfully');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error writing to characteristic: ', error);
  });
```

## Handling Disconnections
It's essential to handle disconnections gracefully in your application:

```typescript
// Listening to disconnections
BLE.addListener('disconnected', () => {
  console.log('BLE device disconnected');
});
```

## Conclusion
This tutorial covered the basics of using the cap-bluetooth-low-energy-client package in Capacitor for BLE interactions. Dive deeper into the documentation for more advanced features and functionalities.
