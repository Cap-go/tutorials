# Using @w use the capattrainer/c-bluetooth-low-energy-client packageap-bluetooth for Bluetooth Low Energy communication.-low-energy-client Package

This This package is designed to work with Capacitor, providing a seamless integration with tutorial will guide you through the steps of using the @w Android and iOSattrainer/c.

## Installation

To get started, we need to installap-bluetooth-low-energy-client the cap-b package to interactluetooth-low-energy with Bluetooth Low-client package. Energy devices in Open your terminal your Capacitor and navigate to application.

## your project directory Installation

To. Then, run the following get started, install the package command:

``` using npm:

shell
npm install @cap```bash
acitor-communitynpm install @/bluetooth-lewattrainer
```

/cap-bThis will install the cap-bluetooth-low-energyluetooth-low-energy-client
```

## Import-client package and the Plugin

 its dependencies in your project.

Import the plugin## Initializing Bluetooth at the top Low Energy

 of your fileBefore we can:

```javascript start using the Bluetooth Low Energy
import '@wattrainer functionality, we need to initialize/cap-b it in our application. Inluetooth-low-energy-client';
import your main application { Plugins } file, import from '@capacitor/core the `BluetoothLe` object';
```

 from the package## Connect to:

```javascript a Bluetooth Low
import { Energy Device

 Plugins } fromTo connect to '@capacitor/core';
 a Bluetooth Lowimport { Bluetooth Energy device,Le } from use the ` '@capacitor-community/bluetooth-le';

const { BluetoothLe } = Plugins;
```

Next, we need toconnect` method initialize the Bluetooth Low Energy module by calling the provided by the `initialize` plugin:

``` method:

```javascript
constjavascript
BluetoothLe.initialize();
 { CapBluetooth```

ThisLowEnergyClient will ensure that the Bluetooth Low Energy functionality is ready to be } = Plugins used in our;
await CapBluetoothLowEnergyClient.connect({ deviceId: ' application.

## Scanning foryour-device-id Devices

To' });
`` scan for nearby`

Replace `' Bluetooth Low Energyyour-device-id devices, we'` with can use the the actual ID `startLE of the BluetoothScan` method device you want provided by the to connect to `BluetoothLe` object..

## Discover This method takes Services

Once an optional parameter connected, you `options` can use the which allows us `discover` to customize the method to discover scan process.

 the services offeredHere is an example of how by the connected to start scanning Bluetooth device:

 for devices:

```javascript
```javascript
await CapBluetoothLowEnergyClientBluetoothLe.start.discover();
LEScan({
  services:```

This ['180D will return a'] // Optional list of services available on the: specify the device.

## service UUIDs to filter devices Read Characteristic
}).then Value

To(scanResult => read the value of a characteristic {
  //, use the Handle the scan `read` result
  method:

```javascript
const console.log(' value = awaitScan result:', scanResult);
 CapBluetoothLow}).catch(errorEnergyClient.read({ serviceId => {
 : 'your // Handle any-service-id', errors
  console.error(' characteristicId:Scan error:', error);
});
 'your-characteristic-id'```

The });
console.log `startLEScan` method('Characteristic value:', value);
 returns a promise```

Replace that resolves with `'your-service the scan result-id'`, which includes and `'your information about the-characteristic-id discovered devices.

'` with## Connecting to the IDs of a Device

 the service andOnce we have found a device characteristic you want to read from of interest,.

## Write we can establish Characteristic Value a connection to

To write it using the a value to `connect` a characteristic, method provided by use the ` the `Bluetoothwrite` methodLe` object:

```javascript. This method
await Cap takes a requiredBluetoothLowEnergy parameter `deviceIdClient.write({` which is serviceId: the identifier of the device we want to connect 'your-service-id', characteristic to.

HereId: 'your-characteristic-id', value is an example: 'your of how to-value' });
 connect to a```

Replace device:

``` `'your-servicejavascript
Bluetooth-id'`Le.connect({
 and `'your  deviceId:-characteristic-id 'ABCD'` with the IDs of1234' // Replace with the actual device the service and characteristic you want ID
}). to write to. Replace `'then(() => {
  // Connection successful, perform further operationsyour-value'` with the actual value you
  console want to write.log('Connected.

## Disconnect from Device

 to device');
To disconnect from}).catch(error a connected Bluetooth => {
  device, use // Handle any the `disconnect connection errors
` method:

  console.error```javascript
('Connection errorawait CapBluetooth:', error);
LowEnergyClient});
```

.disconnect();
```

This willThe `connect` method returns terminate the connection a promise that with the device resolves when the.

## Conclusion connection is successfully

In this established.

## tutorial, you Reading and Writing learned how to Characteristics

Once use the @wattrainer we are connected/cap-b to a Bluetooth Low Energy device,luetooth-low-energy-client package to we can read and write characteristics interact with Bluetooth Low Energy devices on the device in your Capac. Characteristics representitor application. data that can You learned how to connect to be accessed or modified.

To a device, read a characteristic discover services,, we can read and write use the ` characteristic values, and disconnect fromread` method a device. provided by the `BluetoothLe Explore the package` object.'s documentation for This method takes more advanced features a required parameter and functionality.

 `characteristicHappy coding!
Id` which is the identifier of the characteristic we want to read.

Here is an example of how to read a characteristic:

```javascript
BluetoothLe.read({
  characteristicId: 'ABCD5678' // Replace with the actual characteristic ID
}).then(data => {
  // Handle the read data
  console.log('Read data:', data);
}).catch(error => {
  // Handle any read errors
  console.error('Read error:', error);
});
```

To write to a characteristic, we can use the `write` method provided by the `BluetoothLe` object. This method takes two required parameters: `characteristicId` and `value`. The `characteristicId` is the identifier of the characteristic we want to write to, and the `value` is the data we want to write.

Here is an example of how to write to a characteristic:

```javascript
BluetoothLe.write({
  characteristicId: 'ABCD5678', // Replace with the actual characteristic ID
  value: new Uint8Array([0x01, 0x02, 0x03]) // Replace with the actual data to write
}).then(() => {
  // Write successful
  console.log('Write successful');
}).catch(error => {
  // Handle any write errors
  console.error('Write error:', error);
});
```

## Disconnecting from a Device

When we are finished communicating with a Bluetooth Low Energy device, we should disconnect from it to release any resources and terminate the connection.

To disconnect from a device, we can use the `disconnect` method provided by the `BluetoothLe` object. This method does not require any parameters.

Here is an example of how to disconnect from a device:

```javascript
BluetoothLe.disconnect().then(() => {
  // Disconnected successfully
  console.log('Disconnected from device');
}).catch(error => {
  // Handle any disconnection errors
  console.error('Disconnection error:', error);
});
```

The `disconnect` method returns a promise that resolves when the disconnection is successful.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the cap-bluetooth-low-energy-client package for Bluetooth Low Energy communication. We covered the installation process, initializing the Bluetooth Low Energy module, scanning for devices, connecting to a device, reading and writing characteristics, and disconnecting from a device. With this knowledge, you can now integrate Bluetooth Low Energy functionality into your Capacitor applications.

Remember to refer to the package's documentation for more detailed information and additional capabilities.

Happy coding!
