# Using CallObserverPlugin in Ionic

The CallObserverPlugin is a plugin that allows you to observe the status of a phone call in an Ionic application. This can be useful to track the progress of a phone call and perform actions based on its status. In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to integrate and use the CallObserverPlugin in an Ionic application.

## Installation

To start using the CallObserverPlugin, follow these steps:

1. Install the plugin using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install call-observer-plugin
   ```

2. Import the CallObserverPlugin in your Ionic project:
   ```typescript
   import { CallObserverPlugin } from 'call-observer-plugin';
   ```

3. Initialize the plugin in your Ionic project:
   ```typescript
   const callObserver = new CallObserverPlugin();
   ```

## Observing Call Status

Once the plugin is initialized, you can start observing the status of a phone call. Here's an example of how to do that:

```typescript
// Start observing the call status
callObserver.startObserving();

// Listen for changes in call status
callObserver.subscribe((status) => {
  console.log('Call status changed:', status);
  // Perform actions based on the call status
  if (status === 'incoming') {
    // Do something when a call is incoming
  } else if (status === 'dialing') {
    // Do something when a call is dialing
  } else if (status === 'ongoing') {
    // Do something when a call is ongoing
  } else if (status === 'ended') {
    // Do something when a call is ended
  }
});

// Stop observing the call status
callObserver.stopObserving();
```

By subscribing to the call status changes, you can execute different actions based on the current call status. For example, you can show a notification when a call is incoming, or perform some cleanup when a call is ended.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to integrate and use the CallObserverPlugin in an Ionic application. We covered the installation process, as well as how to observe the status of a phone call and perform actions based on its status. This can be a useful feature to enhance the functionality of your Ionic app that interacts with phone calls.
