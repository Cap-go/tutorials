# Using Custom Dialog in Android

The custom-dialog-android package provides an easy way to create custom dialogs in Android applications. With this package, you can customize the title, subtitle, and other elements of the dialog to match your app's design.

To use the custom-dialog-android package, follow these steps:

1. Add the custom-dialog-android dependency to your app's build.gradle file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.example:custom-dialog-android:1.0.0'
}
```

2. Create a new instance of the `CustomDialog` class:

```java
CustomDialog customDialog = new CustomDialog(context);
```

3. Set the title and subtitle for the dialog:

```java
customDialog.setTitle("Custom Dialog");
customDialog.setSubtitle("This is a custom dialog");
```

4. Customize other elements of the dialog as desired. For example, you can change the background color, text color, and button styles:

```java
customDialog.setBackgroundColor(Color.WHITE);
customDialog.setTitleColor(Color.BLACK);
customDialog.setSubtitleColor(Color.GRAY);
customDialog.setButtonStyle(R.drawable.button_style);
```

5. Show the dialog:

```java
customDialog.show();
```

That's it! You have successfully created and shown a custom dialog in your Android application using the custom-dialog-android package.

Remember to customize other elements of the dialog as needed, such as adding buttons, setting click listeners, and handling user interactions.

For more details on the available customization options and additional features, refer to the package documentation.

Now you can enhance user experience in your Android app by using custom dialogs created with the custom-dialog-android package. Happy coding!
