# Using Capacitor Native Google One Tap Signin

In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to integrate the `capacitor-native-google-one-tap-signin` package into your Ionic Capacitor app for Google authentication. This package wraps the native Android One Tap API, providing a seamless and secure sign-in experience.

## Step 1: Installation

First, let's install the `capacitor-native-google-one-tap-signin` package using npm:

```
npm i --save capacitor-native-google-one-tap-signin
```

## Step 2: Update Capacitor Dependencies

Next, we need to update the Capacitor dependencies by running the following command:

```
npx cap update
```

## Step 3: Configure Google Cloud Console

Authentication with Google requires a client ID generated in the Google Cloud Console. Follow these steps to create the client ID:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) and sign in.
2. Create a client ID of type "Web application".
3. For development, add two "Authorized JavaScript origins" with the following URIs: "http://localhost:3000" and "http://localhost".
4. "Authorized redirect URIs" is not needed for this package.
5. Copy the generated client ID.

## Step 4: Initialize the Plugin

In your Ionic Capacitor app, you need to initialize the plugin with the provided client ID. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { Plugins } from "@capacitor/core";

const { CapacitorNativeGoogleOneTap } = Plugins;

CapacitorNativeGoogleOneTap.initialize({
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE",
});
```

Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE` with the client ID obtained from the Google Cloud Console.

## Step 5: Implement Sign-In Functionality

Now, you can implement the sign-in functionality in your app. Here's an example of signing in with Google using the `CapacitorNativeGoogleOneTap.signIn()` method:

```typescript
import { Plugins } from "@capacitor/core";

const { CapacitorNativeGoogleOneTap } = Plugins;

async function signInWithGoogle() {
  try {
    const response = await CapacitorNativeGoogleOneTap.signIn();
    const idToken = response.idToken;
    // Use the idToken for further authentication or retrieve user information
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error signing in with Google:", error);
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated the `capacitor-native-google-one-tap-signin` package into your Ionic Capacitor app for Google authentication. You can now provide a seamless sign-in experience for your users. Feel free to explore the package documentation for additional features and customization options.
