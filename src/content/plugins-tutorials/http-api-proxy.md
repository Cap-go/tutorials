# Using @start9labs/capacitor-http Package Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using the @start9labs/capacitor-http package in your Capacitor app.

## Step 1: Installing the Package

To install the @start9labs/capacitor-http package, you can use the following command:

```
npm install @start9labs/capacitor-http
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Capacitor app, you can import the @start9labs/capacitor-http package using the following code:

```javascript
import { Http } from '@start9labs/capacitor-http';
```

## Step 3: Making HTTP Requests

Once you have imported the package, you can start making HTTP requests. The @start9labs/capacitor-http package provides methods for making GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH requests.

Here's an example of making a GET request:

```javascript
const response = await Http.get('https://api.example.com/users');
console.log(response.data);
```

And here's an example of making a POST request:

```javascript
const data = { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' };
const response = await Http.post('https://api.example.com/users', data);
console.log(response.data);
```

You can use the same pattern for making other types of requests.

## Step 4: Handling Error Responses

The @start9labs/capacitor-http package also provides a way to handle error responses. When a request fails or returns a non-2xx status code, an error will be thrown. You can catch these errors and handle them accordingly.

Here's an example:

```javascript
try {
  const response = await Http.get('https://api.example.com/users');
  console.log(response.data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message);
}
```

## Step 5: Configuring Request Headers

If you need to add custom headers to your requests, you can do so by using the `setHeader` method provided by the @start9labs/capacitor-http package.

Here's an example:

```javascript
Http.setHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN');
```

You can set headers before making any requests, and they will be included in all subsequent requests.

## Step 6: Configuring Request Timeout

You can also configure the request timeout by using the `setTimeout` method provided by the @start9labs/capacitor-http package.

Here's an example:

```javascript
Http.setTimeout(5000); // Set timeout to 5 seconds
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to use the @start9labs/capacitor-http package in your Capacitor app. You can now make HTTP requests, handle error responses, and configure request headers and timeouts.
