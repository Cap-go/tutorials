I don't know the specifics of using the cap-sim-info package to generate a markdown tutorial. However, I can provide you with some guidance on how to add front matter to a markdown file.

You can create a front matter block with the required values for your blog as follows:

```
---
title: Your Blog Title
description: Summary of what will be in the blog
created_at: Date of this answer
published: true
slug: cap-sim-info
---
```

You can add this front matter at the beginning of your markdown file, just before the content of the tutorial.
