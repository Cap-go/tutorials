# Using the `mock-detector` Package

---

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the `mock-detector` package in your JavaScript projects. The `mock-detector` package is a useful tool for detecting mock implementations in your codebase. It can help you identify and manage the usage of mock objects, which can be particularly beneficial in unit testing scenarios.

## Installation

To begin, you will need to install the `mock-detector` package. You can do this by running the following command:

```shell
npm install mock-detector
```

## Getting Started

Once the package is installed, you can import and use it in your code. Here is an example of how to import and use the `mock-detector` package:

```javascript
import { detectMocks } from 'mock-detector';

// Your code here

const mocks = detectMocks();

// Handle the detected mocks
```

## Detecting Mocks

The `detectMocks()` function provided by the `mock-detector` package scans your codebase and returns an array of detected mock objects. You can then handle these mocks according to your requirements.

## Example

Let's consider a practical example to better understand how to use the `mock-detector` package. Suppose we have the following code snippet:

```javascript
import { detectMocks } from 'mock-detector';

class UserService {
  constructor(apiClient) {
    this.apiClient = apiClient;
  }

  getUser(id) {
    return this.apiClient.get(`/users/${id}`);
  }
}

describe('UserService', () => {
  it('should get user', () => {
    const apiClientMock = {
      get: jest.fn(),
    };

    const userService = new UserService(apiClientMock);

    // Mock the response
    apiClientMock.get.mockResolvedValue({
      id: 1,
      name: 'John Doe',
    });

    const user = userService.getUser(1);

    expect(user).resolves.toEqual({
      id: 1,
      name: 'John Doe',
    });
  });
});

const mocks = detectMocks();

console.log(mocks);
```

In this example, `apiClientMock` is a mock object used to simulate the API client. It is created using the `jest.fn()` function provided by Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework. The `detectMocks()` function is then called to detect any mock objects in the code, and the results are logged to the console.

## Conclusion

The `mock-detector` package is a useful tool for detecting mock implementations in your JavaScript projects. It can help you identify and manage the usage of mock objects, which can be valuable in unit testing scenarios. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you should now have a good understanding of how to use the `mock-detector` package in your own projects.
