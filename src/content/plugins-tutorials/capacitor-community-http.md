# Using @arcflow/capacitor-community-http

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `@arcflow/capacitor-community-http` package in a Capacitor app. This package provides a simplified API for making HTTP requests in your Capacitor app.

## Installation

To install the `@arcflow/capacitor-community-http` package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @arcflow/capacitor-community-http
```

## Usage

To use the `@arcflow/capacitor-community-http` package in your Capacitor app, follow these steps:

1. Import the `Http` module from the package:

   ```typescript
   import { Http } from '@arcflow/capacitor-community-http';
   ```

2. Create an instance of the `Http` class:

   ```typescript
   const http = new Http();
   ```

3. Make an HTTP request using the `request` method:

   ```typescript
   const response = await http.request({
     method: 'GET',
     url: 'https://api.example.com/data',
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
     },
   });
   ```

   The `request` method accepts an object with the following properties:

   - `method`: The HTTP method to use (e.g., 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE').
   - `url`: The URL to send the request to.
   - `headers`: An object containing the request headers.
   - `data`: The request payload (optional).

4. Handle the response returned by the server:

   ```typescript
   console.log(response.data); // The response data
   console.log(response.headers); // The response headers
   console.log(response.status); // The response status code
   ```

   The `response` object contains the following properties:

   - `data`: The response data.
   - `headers`: The response headers.
   - `status`: The response status code.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to use the `@arcflow/capacitor-community-http` package to make HTTP requests in a Capacitor app. This package provides a simple API for performing HTTP operations and handling the server responses.
