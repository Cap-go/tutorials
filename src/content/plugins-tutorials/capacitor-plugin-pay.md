# How to Use capacitor-plugin-pay

In this tutorial, we will learn how to integrate and use the capacitor-plugin-pay package in your Capacitor project. The capacitor-plugin-pay package allows you to easily implement payment functionality in your mobile app using various payment providers.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Capacitor installed globally on your machine:
   ```cmd
   npm install -g @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
   ```

2. An existing Capacitor project set up.

## Installation

To start using the capacitor-plugin-pay package, follow these steps:

1. Install the capacitor-plugin-pay package to your Capacitor project:
   ```cmd
   npm install capacitor-plugin-pay
   ```

2. Import the plugin in your code:
   ```ts
   import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
   const { PayPlugin } = Plugins;
   ```

3. Configure the plugin with your payment provider credentials. This step may vary depending on the payment provider you choose. Please refer to the documentation of your selected provider for detailed instructions.

## Usage

Now that the capacitor-plugin-pay package is installed and configured, you can start using it to implement payment functionality in your app. Here's an example of how to use the plugin to make a payment:

1. Create a function to handle the payment:
   ```ts
   async function makePayment(amount: number) {
     try {
       const paymentResult = await PayPlugin.makePayment({ amount });
       console.log('Payment result:', paymentResult);
       // Process the payment result and handle success or failure scenarios
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Payment error:', error);
       // Handle any errors that occur during payment
     }
   }
   ```

2. Call the `makePayment` function with the desired payment amount:
   ```ts
   makePayment(10); // Example payment amount of 10 units
   ```

3. The `makePayment` function will trigger the payment process. Once the payment is completed (or if any errors occur), the corresponding result will be logged to the console.

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated and used the capacitor-plugin-pay package in your Capacitor project.
