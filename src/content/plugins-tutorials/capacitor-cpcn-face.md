# Using the capacitor-cpcn-face package

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the capacitor-cpcn-face package to implement facial recognition capabilities in your Capacitor project. We will cover the installation process, configuring the plugin, and implementing the necessary code to perform facial recognition.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Capacitor project setup and running
- Node.js and npm installed

## Installation
To start using the capacitor-cpcn-face package, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your Capacitor project's root directory.
3. Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
npm install capacitor-cpcn-face
```

## Configuration
Once the package is installed, you need to configure it in your Capacitor project. Follow these steps to configure the package:

1. Open your Capacitor project's root directory.
2. Locate the `capacitor.config.json` file.
3. Add the following entry to the `plugins` section:

```json
{
  "name": "CapacitorCPCNFace",
  "id": "com.example.capacitorcpcnface",
  "path": "node_modules/capacitor-cpcn-face"
}
```

## Usage
With the capacitor-cpcn-face package installed and configured, you can now start using it in your project. Follow these steps to implement facial recognition:

1. Import the necessary modules and define the required variables:

```typescript
import { CapacitorCPCNFace, CPCNFaceResult } from 'capacitor-cpcn-face';

const cpcnFace = new CapacitorCPCNFace();
```

2. Implement the code to perform facial recognition. Here's an example of how to detect faces in an image:

```typescript
const imageUri = 'path_to_image.jpg';

async function detectFaces() {
  try {
    const result: CPCNFaceResult = await cpcnFace.detectFaces({ imageUri });

    console.log(result.faces); // Array of detected faces
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

detectFaces();
```

3. Build and run your Capacitor project to see the facial recognition in action.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to use the capacitor-cpcn-face package to implement facial recognition in a Capacitor project. We covered the installation process, configuration, and usage of the package. Now you can leverage facial recognition capabilities in your Capacitor applications.
