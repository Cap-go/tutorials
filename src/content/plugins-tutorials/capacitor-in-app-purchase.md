# Using the capacitor-in-app-purchase Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to integrate the capacitor-in-app-purchase package into your Capacitor project. The capacitor-in-app-purchase package provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for implementing in-app purchases in your mobile application.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, please ensure that you have the following installed in your development environment:

- Capacitor CLI
- Capacitor Core
- capacitor-in-app-purchase package

If you haven't already, you can install the capacitor-in-app-purchase package by running the following command:

```shell
npm install capacitor-in-app-purchase
```

## Step 1: Set up In-App Purchases

The first step is to set up in-app purchases on the platforms you are targeting. This involves creating products in the respective app store developer consoles and obtaining the necessary product identifiers. Make sure you have the product identifiers ready before proceeding.

## Step 2: Initialize the Plugin

Next, we need to initialize the capacitor-in-app-purchase plugin in our project. This step involves adding a few lines of code to your project's initialization file (such as `app.component.ts`).

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { CapacitorInAppPurchase } = Plugins;

async function initializeInAppPurchases() {
  try {
    await CapacitorInAppPurchase.initialize();
    console.log('In-App Purchases initialized successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to initialize In-App Purchases:', error);
  }
}
```

Make sure to call the `initializeInAppPurchases` function when your app starts up.

## Step 3: Retrieve Available Products

Once the plugin is initialized, we can retrieve the list of available products from the app store. This step allows us to display the available products to the user.

```typescript
async function getAvailableProducts() {
  try {
    const products = await CapacitorInAppPurchase.getProducts(['product1', 'product2']);
    console.log('Available products:', products);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to retrieve available products:', error);
  }
}
```

Replace `product1` and `product2` with the product identifiers you created in the app store.

## Step 4: Make a Purchase

To initiate a purchase, we can use the `purchase` method provided by the capacitor-in-app-purchase package.

```typescript
async function makePurchase(productId: string) {
  try {
    const purchase = await CapacitorInAppPurchase.purchase(productId);
    console.log('Purchase successful:', purchase);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to make a purchase:', error);
  }
}
```

Replace `productId` with the identifier of the product you want to purchase.

## Step 5: Handle Purchase Events

The capacitor-in-app-purchase package provides event listeners for handling purchase events such as successful purchases, failed purchases, and restored purchases. You can use these listeners to update your app's UI and handle the appropriate actions.

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { CapacitorInAppPurchase } = Plugins;

CapacitorInAppPurchase.addListener('purchase', (purchase) => {
  console.log('Purchase successful event:', purchase);
});

CapacitorInAppPurchase.addListener('purchaseError', (error) => {
  console.error('Error during purchase:', error);
});

CapacitorInAppPurchase.addListener('purchaseRestored', (purchase) => {
  console.log('Purchase restored event:', purchase);
});
```

Make sure to add these listeners in a place where they can be registered once and persist across different screens.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to integrate the capacitor-in-app-purchase package into a Capacitor project. We covered setting up in-app purchases, initializing the plugin, retrieving available products, making purchases, and handling purchase events. With this knowledge, you can now implement in-app purchases in your mobile application using Capacitor.

Remember to test your app thoroughly and consult the documentation for more advanced features and scenarios. Happy coding!
