## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the "mypago" package for payment processing. The mypago package is a powerful tool that allows developers to easily integrate payment features into their applications. Whether you're building an e-commerce platform or a subscription-based service, mypago has got you covered. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement payment functionality using the mypago package.

---

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js
- A text editor or IDE of your choice
- Node.js installed on your machine
- An active merchant account with the payment gateway provider

---

## Step 1: Install the Package

To begin, let's install the mypago package. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command:

```shell
npm install mypago
```

This will install the mypago package and its dependencies into your project.

---

## Step 2: Import the Package

Next, let's import the mypago package into your project. Open your JavaScript file and add the following line of code at the top:

```javascript
const mypago = require('mypago');
```

This will import the mypago package and make its functions and methods accessible within your file.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Merchant Account

Before you can start processing payments, you need to set up your merchant account with the payment gateway provider. This typically involves creating an account, providing necessary documentation, and configuring your account settings. Refer to the documentation of your payment gateway provider for detailed instructions on how to set up your merchant account.

---

## Step 4: Configure Your API Credentials

Once your merchant account is set up, you will receive API credentials from the payment gateway provider. These credentials are required to authenticate your API requests. In your JavaScript file, add the following code to configure your API credentials:

```javascript
mypago.configure({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  secretKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
});
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your actual API credentials provided by the payment gateway provider.

---

## Step 5: Process a Payment

Now that your merchant account and API credentials are set up, you're ready to process a payment. In your JavaScript file, add the following code to initiate a payment request:

```javascript
const paymentData = {
  amount: 1000, // Amount in cents
  currency: 'USD',
  description: 'Product Name',
  customer: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john.doe@example.com',
    address: '123 Street, City, Country',
  },
};

mypago.processPayment(paymentData)
  .then((paymentResult) => {
    // Payment successful, handle the result
    console.log('Payment successful:', paymentResult);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Payment failed, handle the error
    console.error('Payment error:', error);
  });
```

Make sure to replace the values in the `paymentData` object with the actual payment details for your application.
