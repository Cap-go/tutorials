# Using the @kduma-autoid/capacitor-webview-watchdog Package

In this tutorial, we will guide you on how to integrate and use the `@kduma-autoid/capacitor-webview-watchdog` package in your Capacitor application. This package provides a convenient way to monitor the status of a WebView component and handle any errors or failures that may occur during its operation.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js and npm
- Capacitor CLI
- Xcode (for iOS development)

## Step 1: Install the Package

To install the `@kduma-autoid/capacitor-webview-watchdog` package, open your terminal and navigate to your Capacitor project's root directory. Then, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @kduma-autoid/capacitor-webview-watchdog
```

## Step 2: Add the Package to your Capacitor Project

Once the installation is complete, you need to add the package to your Capacitor project. Run the following command to sync your project:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

## Step 3: Configure the WebView Watchdog

In order to use the WebView Watchdog, you need to configure it in your project. Open your project's main `android/app/src/main/java/[your.package.name]/MainActivity.java` file for Android or `ios/App/AppDelegate.swift` file for iOS.

### Android

Add the following import statement at the top of the file:

```java
import com.kduma.capacitor.webview.watchdog.WebViewWatchdog;
```

Inside the `onCreate` method, add the following code to register the WebView Watchdog:

```java
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    // ...

    // Register the WebView Watchdog
    WebViewWatchdog.register(this);
}
```

### iOS

Add the following import statement at the top of the file:

```swift
import CapacitorWebViewWatchdog
```

Inside the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method, add the following code to register the WebView Watchdog:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // ...

    // Register the WebView Watchdog
    CapacitorWebViewWatchdog.register()

    return true
}
```

## Step 4: Monitor WebView Errors

With the WebView Watchdog set up, you can now monitor and handle WebView errors in your application. Depending on your use case, you can choose to display an error message, reload the WebView, or take any other appropriate actions.

To monitor WebView errors, you need to add the following code to your WebView component:

```typescript
import { WebViewWatchdog } from '@kduma-autoid/capacitor-webview-watchdog';

// ...

// Add a listener for WebView errors
WebViewWatchdog.addListener('error', (error) => {
    // Handle the error
    console.error('WebView error:', error);

    // Reload the WebView
    webView.reload();
});
```

Make sure to replace `webView` with the instance of your WebView component.

## Step 5: Test the WebView Watchdog

You can now test the WebView Watchdog by intentionally causing an error in your WebView component. For example, you can try loading an invalid URL or simulating a network failure.

When an error occurs in the WebView, the `error` event listener defined in the previous step will be triggered, allowing you to handle the error accordingly.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to integrate and use the `@kduma-autoid/capacitor-webview-watchdog` package to monitor and handle errors in a WebView component in your Capacitor application. By implementing the WebView Watchdog, you can provide a better user experience by gracefully handling any WebView errors that may occur.

For more information on the `@kduma-autoid/capacitor-webview-watchdog` package and its available features, refer to the package's documentation on npm.
