# Using the momoplugin Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of using the momoplugin package in your projects. The momoplugin package is a powerful tool that allows you to integrate momo payments into your applications with ease.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development machine:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- NPM (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

To start using the momoplugin package, you need to install it into your project. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
npm install momoplugin
```

This will install the momoplugin package and add it as a dependency in your project's `package.json` file.

## Getting Started

Once you have installed the momoplugin package, you can import it into your code and start using its functionalities. Here's an example of how to import the package:

```javascript
const momo = require('momoplugin');
```

## Making a Payment

The momoplugin package provides a simple and straightforward API for making payments using the momo payment gateway. To make a payment, follow these steps:

1. Create a new instance of the `momo.Payment` class:

   ```javascript
   const payment = new momo.Payment();
   ```

2. Set the required parameters for the payment:

   ```javascript
   payment.setApiKey('your-api-key');
   payment.setSecretKey('your-secret-key');
   payment.setOrderId('unique-order-id');
   payment.setAmount(1000);
   payment.setDescription('Payment for XYZ product');
   ```

3. Generate a payment URL:

   ```javascript
   const paymentUrl = payment.generatePaymentUrl();
   ```

   The `paymentUrl` variable will now contain the URL that you can redirect your users to for completing the payment.

4. Redirect the user to the payment URL:

   ```javascript
   // Redirect the user to paymentUrl
   // e.g., using a server-side redirect or an anchor tag on the client-side
   ```

4. Handle the payment callback:

   Once the payment is completed, the user will be redirected back to your application. You need to handle the payment callback to verify the transaction and update your application's state accordingly. Here's an example of how to handle the payment callback using Express.js:

   ```javascript
   // Handle the payment callback route
   app.get('/payment/callback', (req, res) => {
     const paymentId = req.query.paymentId;
     const orderId = req.query.orderId;
     const status = req.query.status;
   
     // Verify the payment using momo.Payment.verifyPayment method
     const payment = new momo.Payment();
     payment.setApiKey('your-api-key');
     payment.setSecretKey('your-secret-key');
   
     payment.verifyPayment(paymentId, orderId, (error, result) => {
       if (error) {
         // Handle payment verification error
       } else {
         // Payment verification successful
         // Update your application's state based on the payment result
       }
     });
   });
   ```

And that's it! You have now successfully integrated the momo payment gateway into your application using the momoplugin package. You can customize the payment flow and handle different scenarios based on your requirements.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have covered the installation process of the momoplugin package and walked through the steps of making a payment using the momo payment gateway. The momoplugin package provides a convenient way to integrate momo payments into your applications and provides flexibility for handling payment callbacks.

Remember to refer to the official documentation of the momoplugin package for more detailed information and advanced usage scenarios. Happy coding!

> Note: This tutorial assumes you have already set up a server-side application to handle momo payments and callbacks. The example code provided uses Express.js for simplicity.
