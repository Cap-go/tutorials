# Using Capacitor-HTTP-Client Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the capacitor-http-client package to make HTTP requests in a Capacitor app.

## Installation

To get started, first install the capacitor-http-client package by running the following command:

```bash
npm install capacitor-http-client
```

## Importing the Package

Once the package is installed, you can import it into your project by adding the following line of code:

```javascript

```

## Making a GET Request

To make a GET request using the capacitor-http-client, you can use the `get()` method. Here's an example:

const http = new Http();

http.get('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Response:', response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

## Making a POST Request

```javascript
const http = new Http();

const data = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com'
};

http.post('https://api.example.com/users', data)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Response:', response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```
