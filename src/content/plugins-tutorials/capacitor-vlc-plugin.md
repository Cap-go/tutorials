```typescript
import { CapacitorVlcPlugin } from 'capacitor-vlc-plugin';
const vlcPlugin = CapacitorVlcPlugin;
```

### 2. Initialize the VLC Player

Before playing a video, you need to initialize the VLC player by calling the `initializePlayer()` method.

```typescript
const initializePlayer = async () => {
  await vlcPlugin.initializePlayer();
};
```

### 3. Load a Video

To load a video into the VLC player, use the `loadVideo()` method and provide the video URL or file path as an argument.

```typescript
const loadVideo = async (videoUrl: string) => {
  await vlcPlugin.loadVideo({ url: videoUrl });
};
```

### 4. Play the Video

To start playing the loaded video, call the `play()` method.

```typescript
const playVideo = async () => {
  await vlcPlugin.play();
};
```

### 5. Stop the Video

To stop the video playback, use the `stop()` method.

```typescript
const stopVideo = async () => {
  await vlcPlugin.stop();
};
```

### 6. Release the Player

After you have finished using the VLC player, make sure to release it by calling the `releasePlayer()` method.

```typescript
const releasePlayer = async () => {
  await vlcPlugin.releasePlayer();
};
```
