# Using the `ionic-plugin-printer-by-paulobunga` Package

The `ionic-plugin-printer-by-paulobunga` package is a useful plugin for printing HTML format values in your Ionic apps. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the installation process and teach you how to use the plugin to print various types of content.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Ionic CLI installed globally
- Capacitor installed in your Ionic project
- Basic knowledge of Ionic and Capacitor

## Installation

To install the `ionic-plugin-printer-by-paulobunga` package, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your Ionic project directory.
2. Run the following command to install the package using npm:

```bash
npm install ionic-plugin-printer-by-paulobunga
```

3. After the installation is complete, synchronize your Capacitor project by running the following command:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Ionic project. Here's an example of how to print a simple text using the `ionic-plugin-printer-by-paulobunga` package:

```typescript
import { Printer } from 'ionic-plugin-printer-by-paulobunga';

...

Printer.print({ content: 'Hello, world!' })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Printing complete');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Printing failed:', error);
  });
```

In the above code, we import the `Printer` object from the `ionic-plugin-printer-by-paulobunga` package. Then, we call the `print` method and pass the content we want to print as a parameter. The `print` method returns a promise that resolves when the printing is complete or rejects if an error occurs.

You can also print HTML content using the package. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { Printer } from 'ionic-plugin-printer-by-paulobunga';

...

Printer.print({ content: '<h1>Welcome</h1><p>This is a sample HTML content.</p>' })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Printing complete');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Printing failed:', error);
  });
```

In this case, we pass the HTML content as a string to the `content` parameter of the `print` method. The package supports CSS inline styling, so you can customize the appearance of the printed content.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the `ionic-plugin-printer-by-paulobunga` package to print HTML format values in an Ionic app. We covered the installation process and demonstrated how to print both simple text and HTML content. You can now integrate this package into your Ionic projects and add printing functionality to enhance the user experience.
