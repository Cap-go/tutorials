I'm sorry, but I don't have access to the content of the package @matiasfic/metamap-capacitor-plugin or the ability to generate a markdown tutorial. However, I can provide you with the links to the MetaMap for Capacitor usage guide and changelog, which might help you in understanding and using the package:

- [Usage guide](https://github.com/matiasfic/metamap-capacitor-plugin/blob/main/docs/metaMap-capacitor.md)
- [Changelog](https://github.com/matiasfic/metamap-capacitor-plugin/blob/main/docs/metamap-capacitor-changelog.md)

As for the frontmatter you mentioned, you can manually add it to the markdown file. Here is an example of how it could look:

```
---
title: "Your Blog Title"
description: "A summary of what will be in the blog"
created_at: "Insert date here"
published: true
slug: "metamap-capacitor-plugin"
---

# Your tutorial content goes here
```

Please note that you'll need to replace the placeholder values with the appropriate information.
