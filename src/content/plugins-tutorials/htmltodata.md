# Using htmltodata Package

The `htmltodata` package is a useful tool for converting HTML into data. Whether you want to extract data from a website or manipulate HTML content programmatically, this package provides a simple and efficient way to achieve your goals.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the `htmltodata` package using npm. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install htmltodata
```

Once the package is installed, you also need to sync it with your project using the following command:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

## API

The `htmltodata` package provides several methods that you can use to convert HTML to data. Let's go through each of them:

### echo

The `echo` method takes a string value as input and returns the same value as output. It can be used for testing purposes or as a placeholder in your code. Here's how you can use it:

```typescript
import { echo } from 'htmltodata';

const result = await echo({ value: 'Hello, World!' });
console.log(result.value); // Output: Hello, World!
```

### htmlstringToBase64

The `htmlstringToBase64` method converts an HTML string into a Base64-encoded string. This can be useful when you need to transmit or store HTML data as a string. Here's an example usage:

```typescript
import { htmlstringToBase64 } from 'htmltodata';

const htmlString = '<h1>Hello, World!</h1>';
const result = await htmlstringToBase64({ value: htmlString });
console.log(result.value); // Output: SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==
```

### printDefaultiOS

The `printDefaultiOS` method is specifically designed for iOS platforms. It takes a string value as input and prints it to the default iOS printer. This can be handy when you want to generate a PDF or physically print HTML content. Here's how you can use it:

```typescript
import { printDefaultiOS } from 'htmltodata';

const htmlContent = '<h1>Hello, World!</h1>';
const result = await printDefaultiOS({ value: htmlContent });
console.log(result.value); // Output: Printing successful!
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored the `htmltodata` package and learned how to use it to convert HTML to data. We covered the installation process and the usage of three important methods: `echo`, `htmlstringToBase64`, and `printDefaultiOS`. With the knowledge gained from this tutorial, you can now efficiently work with HTML content and extract data as needed.
