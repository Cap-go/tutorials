# Using the `passive-face-liveness-ionic-nosentry` Package

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `passive-face-liveness-ionic-nosentry` package to implement passive face liveness detection in an Ionic application. Passive face liveness detection is a technique used to verify that a live human is present in front of the camera, as opposed to a still image or a video playback. This package provides an easy-to-use solution to integrate passive face liveness detection into your Ionic app.

## Prerequisites
Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

1. An Ionic project set up and running.
2. Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Installing the Package
To install the `passive-face-liveness-ionic-nosentry` package, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your Ionic project's root directory.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install passive-face-liveness-ionic-nosentry
```

This will install the package and add it to your project's `package.json` file.

## Implementing Face Liveness Detection
Now that the package is installed, let's see how to implement face liveness detection in your Ionic app.

1. Import the necessary components from the package in your Ionic project's component:

```typescript
import { PassiveFaceLivenessService } from 'passive-face-liveness-ionic-nosentry';
```

2. Inject the `PassiveFaceLivenessService` into your component's constructor:

```typescript
constructor(private passiveFaceLivenessService: PassiveFaceLivenessService) { }
```

3. Use the `passiveFaceLivenessService` to perform face liveness checks in your app. Here's a basic example:

```typescript
checkFaceLiveness() {
  this.passiveFaceLivenessService.performLivenessCheck()
    .then(result => {
      // Handle the result
      console.log(result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      // Handle the error
      console.error(error);
    });
}
```

4. Call the `checkFaceLiveness()` function to trigger the face liveness check.

That's it! You have successfully implemented passive face liveness detection in your Ionic app using the `passive-face-liveness-ionic-nosentry` package.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to use the `passive-face-liveness-ionic-nosentry` package to incorporate passive face liveness detection into an Ionic application. We installed the package, implemented the necessary code, and performed face liveness checks. You can now leverage this package's features to enhance the security of your Ionic app.
