# Using the notification_info package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the notification_info package to manage notifications in your app. The notification_info package is a powerful tool that allows you to handle different aspects of notifications, including displaying custom content, scheduling notifications, and managing notification actions. Let's get started!

## Installation

To begin using the notification_info package, you need to install it in your project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install notification_info
```

Once the installation is complete, you can import the package in your code using the following import statement:

```javascript
import 'notification_info';
```

## Displaying Custom Content

The notification_info package provides a way to display custom content in your notifications. This can be done by providing a custom HTML template for your notifications. 

Here is an example of how to display custom content in a notification using the notification_info package:

```javascript
import 'notification_info';

// Create a custom HTML template for the notification
const template = `
  <div>
    <h1>New Notification</h1>
    <p>This is a custom notification with custom content.</p>
  </div>
`;

// Display the notification with the custom template
notification_info.displayNotification(template);
```

By using a custom HTML template, you can fully customize the content of your notifications.

## Scheduling Notifications

The notification_info package also allows you to schedule notifications to be displayed at a specific date and time. This can be useful for sending reminders or time-sensitive information to your users.

Here is an example of how to schedule a notification using the notification_info package:

```javascript
import 'notification_info';

// Create a Date object for the desired schedule time
const scheduleTime = new Date('2023-09-21T09:00:00');

// Set the notification body and schedule time
const notification = {
  body: 'This is a scheduled notification!',
  scheduleAt: scheduleTime,
};

// Schedule the notification
notification_info.scheduleNotification(notification);
```

By setting the `scheduleAt` property of the notification object, you can specify the date and time when the notification should be displayed.

## Managing Notification Actions

The notification_info package provides a way to associate actions with your notifications. These actions can be triggered when the user interacts with the notification, such as tapping on a button or swiping the notification.

Here is an example of how to associate an action with a notification using the notification_info package:

```javascript
import 'notification_info';

// Create a notification with an action
const notification = {
  body: 'This notification has an action!',
  actionTypeId: 'open-url',
};

// Add the notification action
notification_info.addAction(notification.actionTypeId, {
  title: 'Open App',
  url: 'myapp://open',
});

// Display the notification
notification_info.displayNotification(notification);
```

In this example, we create a notification with an action of type `open-url`. We then add the action using the `addAction` method, specifying the title and the URL to be triggered when the action is activated.
