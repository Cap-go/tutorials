## Tutorial: Using Capacitor Choose Video Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the Capacitor Choose Video package to select a video in your Capacitor app. The package allows you to open the native video picker on both iOS and Android devices and retrieve the selected video file.

### Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- Capacitor installed globally (`npm install -g @capacitor/core`)
- An existing Capacitor app or a new Capacitor app created using `@capacitor/create-app`

### Step 1: Install the Package

First, install the Capacitor Choose Video package in your Capacitor app by running the following command:

```bash
npm install capacitor-choose-video
```

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your project, open the file where you want to use the Capacitor Choose Video package. Import the package at the top of the file:

```javascript
import { CapacitorChooseVideo } from 'capacitor-choose-video';
```

### Step 3: Use the Package

To use the Capacitor Choose Video package, you can create a function that will be triggered when the user wants to select a video. For example:

```javascript
async function selectVideo() {
  const result = await CapacitorChooseVideo.selectVideo();
  if (result.path) {
    // Do something with the selected video file
    console.log('Selected video path:', result.path);
  } else {
    // User canceled the video selection
    console.log('Video selection canceled');
  }
}
```

In this example, when the `selectVideo()` function is called, it will open the native video picker. Once the user selects a video or cancels the selection, the result will be returned. If a video is selected, you can access its path using `result.path`.

### Step 4: Test the Package

To test the Capacitor Choose Video package, you can call the `selectVideo()` function from a button or any other UI element in your app. For example:

```html
<button onClick="selectVideo()">Select Video</button>
```

When the button is clicked, it will trigger the `selectVideo()` function, which will open the native video picker. After selecting a video, the path of the selected video will be logged to the console.

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to use the Capacitor Choose Video package to select a video in your Capacitor app. You can now integrate video selection functionality into your app and enhance the user experience.
