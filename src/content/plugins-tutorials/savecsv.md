# Using the @rhdj/save-csv Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `@rhdj/save-csv` package to save a CSV file. The package provides a simple API that allows you to easily save data in CSV format.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the `@rhdj/save-csv` package. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install @rhdj/save-csv
```

## Saving a CSV File

Once you have installed the package, you can start saving CSV files. The `saveCsv` function is used to save a CSV file. It takes an array of data objects as input and returns a Promise that resolves when the file is saved successfully.

Here is an example of how to use the `saveCsv` function:

```javascript
const { saveCsv } = require('@rhdj/save-csv');

// Sample data
const data = [
  { name: "John Doe", age: 30, city: "New York" },
  { name: "Jane Smith", age: 25, city: "London" },
  { name: "David Johnson", age: 35, city: "Paris" },
];

// Saving the data as a CSV file
saveCsv(data)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("CSV file saved successfully");
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error saving CSV file:", error);
  });
```

In the above example, we first import the `saveCsv` function from the `@rhdj/save-csv` package. We then define some sample data in the form of an array of objects. Finally, we call the `saveCsv` function with the data array and handle the success and error cases using promises.

That's it! You have successfully learned how to use the `@rhdj/save-csv` package to save a CSV file.

Remember to handle any errors that may occur while saving the file and ensure that the data you pass to the `saveCsv` function is in the correct format.

Happy coding!
