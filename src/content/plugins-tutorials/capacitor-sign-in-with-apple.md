## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to integrate the Sign In with Apple functionality into your Capacitor project using the @changenode/capacitor-sign-in-with-apple package. This package provides a simple and efficient way to handle Apple's authentication mechanism within your mobile applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- Capacitor: Make sure you have Capacitor set up in your project. If not, you can refer to the official Capacitor documentation for installation and configuration instructions.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the @changenode/capacitor-sign-in-with-apple package, follow these steps:

1. Install the package by running the following command in your project's root directory:

   ```shell
   npm install @changenode/capacitor-sign-in-with-apple
   ```

2. Import the package in the necessary files, such as your login component or authentication service:

   ```typescript
   import '@changenode/capacitor-sign-in-with-apple';
   ```

3. Initialize the Sign In with Apple plugin in your project's main file, typically `app.ts` or `main.ts`:

   ```typescript
   import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

   const { SignInWithApple } = Plugins;

   SignInWithApple.initialize({
     // Configuration options
   });
   ```

4. Implement the Sign In with Apple functionality in your login component or any other relevant part of your application. Here's an example of a basic implementation:

   ```typescript
   import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

   const { SignInWithApple } = Plugins;

   const handleSignInWithApple = async () => {
     try {
       const response = await SignInWithApple.signIn();
       console.log(response);
       // Process the authentication response
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(error);
       // Handle error
     }
   }
   ```

   This example demonstrates how to trigger the Sign In with Apple flow and handle the authentication response.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated the @changenode/capacitor-sign-in-with-apple package into your Capacitor project, allowing users to authenticate using their Apple accounts.
