# Using the capacitor-plugin-write-file-permission Package

The capacitor-plugin-write-file-permission package is a useful tool for handling file writing permissions in Capacitor applications. In this tutorial, we will guide you on how to use this package effectively. 

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started)

## Installation

To install and use the capacitor-plugin-write-file-permission package, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your Capacitor project directory.
2. Run the following command to install the package:

   ```bash
   npm install capacitor-plugin-write-file-permission
   ```

3. After the installation is complete, run the following command to synchronize the native dependencies:

   ```bash
   npx cap sync
   ```

## Configuring Permissions

To handle file writing permissions, you need to configure the necessary permissions in your Android and iOS projects.

### Android

1. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permission inside the `<manifest>` tag:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
   ```

### iOS

1. Open your Capacitor project in Xcode by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npx cap open ios
   ```

2. In Xcode, navigate to the `Info.plist` file.
3. Add a new entry with the key `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription`.
4. Set the value for this entry to describe why your app needs write access to the photo library.

## Using the Plugin

Now that you have installed and configured the capacitor-plugin-write-file-permission package, you can start using it in your Capacitor application.

### Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use the package to write a file:

```javascript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { WriteFilePermission } = Plugins;

const writeToFile = async () => {
  const content = 'This is the content to be written to the file';

  try {
    const result = await WriteFilePermission.writeFile({
      path: 'path/to/file.txt',
      data: content,
    });

    if (result.success) {
      console.log('File successfully written');
    } else {
      console.error('Failed to write file');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error writing file:', error);
  }
};

writeToFile();
```

In this example, we import the `WriteFilePermission` plugin from the `@capacitor/core` package. We then define an `async` function called `writeToFile` which utilizes the `writeFile` method of the `WriteFilePermission` plugin to write the provided content to a file at the specified path.

If the file is successfully written, a success message is logged to the console. Otherwise, an error message is logged.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to use the capacitor-plugin-write-file-permission package to handle file writing permissions in Capacitor. Now you can integrate file writing functionality into your Capacitor applications with ease. Happy coding!

Remember to check the official Capacitor documentation and the documentation of the capacitor-plugin-write-file-permission package for more information and advanced usage.
