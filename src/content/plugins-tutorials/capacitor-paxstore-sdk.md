# Using the Capacitor-Paxstore-SDK Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the Capacitor-Paxstore-SDK package to enhance your Capacitor app with Paxstore functionality. The Capacitor-Paxstore-SDK package provides a set of APIs and utilities that allow you to interact with Paxstore services and perform tasks such as managing devices, applications, and users.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. A Capacitor app set up and configured.
2. Node.js and npm installed on your development machine.
3. An account on Paxstore and the necessary credentials to access the Paxstore APIs.

## Step 1: Install the Capacitor-Paxstore-SDK Package
To get started, we need to install the Capacitor-Paxstore-SDK package. Open a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
npm install capacitor-paxstore-sdk
```

## Step 2: Configure the Capacitor-Paxstore-SDK Package
Next, we need to configure the Capacitor-Paxstore-SDK package with your Paxstore credentials. Open the `capacitor.config.json` file and add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "CapacitorPaxstoreSDK": {
      "paxstoreId": "<YOUR_PAXSTORE_ID>",
      "paxstoreApiKey": "<YOUR_PAXSTORE_API_KEY>"
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace `<YOUR_PAXSTORE_ID>` with your Paxstore ID and `<YOUR_PAXSTORE_API_KEY>` with your Paxstore API key.

## Step 3: Import and Initialize the Paxstore SDK
Now, let's import and initialize the Paxstore SDK in our application code. Open the `src/main.ts` file and add the following code:

```typescript
import { CapacitorPaxstoreSDK } from 'capacitor-paxstore-sdk';

CapacitorPaxstoreSDK.initialize().then(() => {
  console.log('Paxstore SDK initialized successfully');
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Failed to initialize Paxstore SDK:', error);
});
```

The `initialize()` method will initialize the Paxstore SDK with the provided credentials. You can also specify additional configuration options when calling the `initialize()` method.

## Step 4: Interact with Paxstore APIs
With the Capacitor-Paxstore-SDK package configured and initialized, we can now start using its APIs to interact with Paxstore services. Here are some examples of common tasks:

### Retrieve the Device List
To retrieve the list of devices managed by Paxstore, use the `getDevices()` method:

```typescript
CapacitorPaxstoreSDK.getDevices().then((devices) => {
  console.log('Devices:', devices);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Failed to retrieve devices:', error);
});
```

### Install an Application
To install an application on a device, use the `installApplication()` method:

```typescript
const deviceId = '<DEVICE_ID>';
const applicationId = '<APPLICATION_ID>';

CapacitorPaxstoreSDK.installApplication(deviceId, applicationId).then(() => {
  console.log('Application installed successfully');
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Failed to install application:', error);
});
```

Make sure to replace `<DEVICE_ID>` with the ID of the target device and `<APPLICATION_ID>` with the ID of the application to be installed.

### Manage Users
To manage users in Paxstore, you can use methods such as `createUser()`, `getUser()`, `updateUser()`, and `deleteUser()`. These methods allow you to create new users, retrieve user details, update user information, and delete users, respectively.

```typescript
// Create a new user
const newUser = {
  username: 'john.doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
};

CapacitorPaxstoreSDK.createUser(newUser).then(() => {
  console.log('New user created successfully');
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Failed to create user:', error);
});

// Retrieve user details
const userId = '<USER_ID>';

CapacitorPaxstoreSDK.getUser(userId).then((user) => {
  console.log('User details:', user);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Failed to retrieve user details:', error);
});

// Update user information
const updatedUser = {
  id: '<USER_ID>',
  username: 'jane.doe',
  email: 'jane.doe@example.com'
};

CapacitorPaxstoreSDK.updateUser(updatedUser).then(() => {
  console.log('User information updated successfully');
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Failed to update user information:', error);
});

// Delete user
const userIdToDelete = '<USER_ID>';

CapacitorPaxstoreSDK.deleteUser(userIdToDelete).then(() => {
  console.log('User deleted successfully');
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Failed to delete user:', error);
});
```

These are just a few examples of the available APIs provided by the Capacitor-Paxstore-SDK package. Refer to the official documentation for a complete list of APIs and their usage.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to use the Capacitor-Paxstore-SDK package to enhance your Capacitor app with Paxstore functionality. We covered the installation and configuration of the package, initializing the Paxstore SDK, and interacting with Paxstore services using the provided APIs. You can now leverage the power of Paxstore to manage devices, install applications, and manage users in your Capacitor app.

Remember to refer to the official documentation and explore the available APIs for more advanced usage and customization options. Happy coding!
