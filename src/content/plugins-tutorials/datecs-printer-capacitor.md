# Using the datecs-printer-capacitor Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the datecs-printer-capacitor package to enable printing functionality in Capacitor apps.

## Installation

To get started, we need to install the datecs-printer-capacitor package in our Capacitor project. Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install datecs-printer-capacitor
```

## Configuring the Printer

Before we can start printing, we need to configure the printer connection. To do this, we need to initialize the printer plugin and set the appropriate printer options. Here is an example:

```typescript
import { DatecsPrinterCapacitor } from 'datecs-printer-capacitor';

const printerPlugin = new DatecsPrinterCapacitor();

async function configurePrinter() {
  try {
    await printerPlugin.initialize(); // Initialize the printer plugin
    await printerPlugin.selectDevice(); // Select the printer device
    await printerPlugin.connect(); // Connect to the printer
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to configure the printer', error);
  }
}

configurePrinter();
```

Make sure to import the `DatecsPrinterCapacitor` class from the `datecs-printer-capacitor` package and create a new instance of it. Then, use the provided methods to initialize the plugin, select the printer device, and establish a connection with the printer.

## Printing a Text

Once the printer is configured, we can start printing text. The `printText` method allows us to print a simple text string. Here is an example:

```typescript
async function printText() {
  try {
    await printerPlugin.printText('Hello, World!'); // Print a text
    await printerPlugin.cutPaper(); // Cut the paper
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to print', error);
  }
}

printText();
```

In this example, we use the `printText` method to send a text string to the printer for printing. After printing the text, we use the `cutPaper` method to cut the paper.

## Printing a QR Code

The datecs-printer-capacitor package also supports printing QR codes. To print a QR code, we need to provide the data and size of the QR code. Here is an example:

```typescript
async function printQRCode() {
  try {
    const data = 'https://example.com'; // URL or any text data
    const size = 200; // Size of the QR code image

    await printerPlugin.printQRCode(data, size); // Print a QR code
    await printerPlugin.cutPaper(); // Cut the paper
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to print QR code', error);
  }
}

printQRCode();
```

In this example, we use the `printQRCode` method to send a data string and the size of the QR code to the printer. The printer will then generate and print the QR code image.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the datecs-printer-capacitor package to enable printing functionality in Capacitor apps. We covered how to configure the printer, print text, and print QR codes. With this knowledge, you can now integrate printing capabilities into your Capacitor projects.
