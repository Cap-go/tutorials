# Using uuid-get package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `uuid-get` package to generate UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) in your JavaScript projects. UUIDs are commonly used to assign unique identifiers to entities in databases or as unique keys in distributed systems.

## Installation

To start using the `uuid-get` package, you need to install it in your project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install uuid-get
```

This will install the `uuid-get` package and its dependencies in your project.

## Generating UUIDs

Once you have installed the `uuid-get` package, you can use it to generate UUIDs in your JavaScript code.

To generate a UUID, import the `uuid` function from the `uuid-get` package and call it without any arguments. Here's an example:

```javascript
const { uuid } = require('uuid-get');

const myUUID = uuid();
console.log(myUUID); // Output: 9f8c81fb-997d-4c2d-bc13-cb3544c79c86
```

In the above code, we import the `uuid` function from the `uuid-get` package and call it to generate a UUID. We then log the generated UUID to the console.

You can use the generated UUIDs in various scenarios, such as assigning unique identifiers to entities in a database or generating unique keys for distributed systems.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the `uuid-get` package to generate UUIDs in your JavaScript projects. We installed the package, imported the `uuid` function, and used it to generate a UUID. UUIDs are widely used for unique identification purposes and can be utilized in various scenarios such as databases and distributed systems.
