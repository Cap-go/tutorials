# Using the capacitor-camera-overlay Package

The capacitor-camera-overlay package allows you to overlay elements on the camera view in a Capacitor app. This can be useful for adding custom buttons, filters, or other UI elements to enhance the camera experience in your app.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and NPM
- Capacitor CLI

## Installation

To install the capacitor-camera-overlay package, open a terminal and navigate to your Capacitor project's root directory. Then, run the following command:

```bash
npm install capacitor-camera-overlay
```

## Usage

1. Import the `CameraOverlay` class from the capacitor-camera-overlay package in your `app.ts` file:

```typescript
import { CameraOverlay } from 'capacitor-camera-overlay';
```

2. Create an instance of the `CameraOverlay` class and initialize it:

```typescript
const cameraOverlay = new CameraOverlay();
await cameraOverlay.initialize();
```

3. Configure the camera overlay by specifying the desired options. For example, to set the overlay color to red with an opacity of 0.5, use the `setOverlayOptions` method:

```typescript
cameraOverlay.setOverlayOptions({
  color: 'red',
  opacity: 0.5,
});
```

4. Show the camera overlay by calling the `showOverlay` method:

```typescript
cameraOverlay.showOverlay();
```

5. Hide the camera overlay by calling the `hideOverlay` method:

```typescript
cameraOverlay.hideOverlay();
```

6. Clean up the camera overlay by calling the `destroy` method when it is no longer needed:

```typescript
cameraOverlay.destroy();
```

That's it! You have now learned how to use the capacitor-camera-overlay package to overlay elements on the camera view in a Capacitor app.
