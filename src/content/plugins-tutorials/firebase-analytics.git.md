In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to implement the @capacitor-community/firebase-analytics package in your Capacitor project.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
- Capacitor project set up
- Basic knowledge of Capacitor and Ionic development

Let's get started!

### Installation
1. Add the @capacitor-community/firebase-analytics package to your project by running the following command:

   ```bash

### Logging Events
3. To log an event using Firebase Analytics, use the following method:

   ```typescript
   public async logEvent(eventName: string, params: any): Promise<void> {
       try {
           await CapacitorFirebaseAnalytics.logEvent(eventName, params);
           console.log('Event logged successfully.');
       } catch (error) {
           console.error('Error logging event:', error);
       }
   }
   ```

4. Call the `logEvent` method with the event name and parameters to log events.

   ```typescript
   public async logScreenView(screenName: string): Promise<void> {
       try {
           await CapacitorFirebaseAnalytics.logScreenView(screenName);
           console.log('Screen view tracked successfully.');
       } catch (error) {
           console.error('Error tracking screen view:', error);
       }
   }
   ```

6. Invoke the `logScreenView` method with the screen name to track screen views.
