# Using capacitor-plugin-event Package Tutorial

The **capacitor-plugin-event** package is a useful tool for handling events in your Ionic applications. Follow this tutorial to learn how to integrate and use this package effectively.

## Installation

To begin, make sure you have Capacitor installed globally on your machine:

```cmd
npm install -g @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
```

## Creating a New Plugin

You can generate a new Capacitor plugin using the following commands:

```cmd
$ npx cap plugin:generate
*  Creating new Capacitor plugin
? Plugin npm name (kebab-case. ex: capacitor-plugin-example): capacitor-plugin-event
? Plugin id (domain-style syntax. ex: com.mycompany.plugins.example) com.yourcompany.plugins.event
? Plugin class name (ex: Example) Event
? description: Handle events in Ionic app
? git repository: https://github.com/yourgithubusername/capacitor-plugin-event.git
? author: Your Name
? license: MIT
? package.json will be created, do you want to continue? Yes
```

## Defining Event Handling Functions

Once you have generated the plugin, you can define event handling functions in the plugin interface. Add custom event functions to the `EventPluginPlugin` interface in the `src/definitions.ts` file.

```ts
export interface EventPluginPlugin {
  on(eventName: string, callback: Function): void;
  off(eventName: string, callback: Function): void;
  emit(eventName: string, data?: any): void;
}
```

## Implementing Event Handling

Now, you can implement event handling logic in your Capacitor plugin code for the web, iOS, and Android platforms.

- For the web implementation, refer to the [Capacitor Web/PWA Plugin Guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/plugins/web).
- For iOS, see the [Capacitor iOS Plugin Guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/plugins/ios).
- For Android, consult the [Capacitor Android Plugin Guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/plugins/android).

## Testing Locally

To test the event handling functionality locally during your development process, link the plugin folder to your app project using the `npm link` command.

1. Run `npm link` within the plugin folder.
2. Then, within your testing project, run:

```cmd
$ npm link capacitor-plugin-event
$ npm install capacitor-plugin-event
```

By following these steps, you can effectively incorporate event handling capabilities into your Ionic apps using the **capacitor-plugin-event** package.
