# Using the Android Billdesk Plugin for Ionic Apps

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of integrating the android-billdesk-plugin package into your Ionic apps. This plugin allows you to implement in-app purchases in your Android application using the Billdesk payment gateway.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- Ionic CLI installed
- Android development environment set up
- A Billdesk account and API key

## Step 1: Create a new Ionic App

Start by creating a new Ionic app using the Ionic CLI. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```shell
ionic start my-app blank
```

This will create a new Ionic app in a directory called `my-app`.

## Step 2: Install the Android Billdesk Plugin

Navigate to the root directory of your Ionic app and install the android-billdesk-plugin package from npm. Run the following command:

```shell
npm install android-billdesk-plugin
```

## Step 3: Configure the Plugin

Open the `src/app/app.module.ts` file in your project and import the `AndroidBilldeskPlugin` from the android-billdesk-plugin package. Add it to the `providers` array in the `@NgModule` decorator:

```typescript
import { AndroidBilldeskPlugin } from 'android-billdesk-plugin';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  entryComponents: [],
  imports: [BrowserModule, IonicModule.forRoot(), AppRoutingModule],
  providers: [
    StatusBar,
    SplashScreen,
    AndroidBilldeskPlugin, // Add this line
    { provide: RouteReuseStrategy, useClass: IonicRouteStrategy },
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Step 4: Implement In-App Purchases

Now you can use the AndroidBilldeskPlugin in your components to implement in-app purchases. Here's an example of how to use the plugin in a component:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { AndroidBilldeskPlugin } from 'android-billdesk-plugin';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  template: `
    <ion-button (click)="purchaseItem()">Purchase Item</ion-button>
  `,
})
export class HomePage {
  constructor(private billdeskPlugin: AndroidBilldeskPlugin) {}

  purchaseItem() {
    this.billdeskPlugin.launchBillingFlow()
      .then((result: any) => {
        // Handle successful purchase
      })
      .catch(() => {
        // Handle purchase failure
      });
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the `AndroidBilldeskPlugin` and inject it into our component. We then use the `launchBillingFlow()` method to initiate the in-app purchase flow. You can handle the result of the purchase in the `then()` block and handle any errors in the `catch()` block.

## Step 5: Test the App

You can now test the app on an Android device or emulator. Build the app using the following command:

```shell
ionic build
```

Then, deploy the app to your device or emulator:

```shell
ionic cordova run android
```

Make sure you have a valid Billdesk account and API key configured in your app for the in-app purchases to work properly.

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated the android-billdesk-plugin package into your Ionic app for in-app purchases using the Billdesk payment gateway.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to use the android-billdesk-plugin package to implement in-app purchases in your Ionic apps. You can now enable your users to purchase items or unlock premium features within your app using the Billdesk payment gateway. Remember to test your app thoroughly and handle any possible edge cases in your code.

Happy coding!
