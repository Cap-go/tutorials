## Installation
The `capacitor-detect-mobile-services` package allows you to detect various mobile services in your Capacitor app. Follow these steps to integrate it into your project.

### Step 1: Install the Package
```bash
npm install capacitor-detect-mobile-services
```

### Step 2: Sync with Capacitor
```bash
npx cap sync
```

## Usage
After installing the package, you can start detecting mobile services in your app.

### Detecting Network Availability
You can check the availability of the network in your app by using the following code snippet:

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { Network } = Plugins;

const checkNetworkStatus = async () => {
  const { connected } = await Network.getStatus();
  if (connected) {
    console.log('Network is available.');
  } else {
    console.log('Network is not available.');
  }
};
```

### Detecting Battery Information
To get information about the device's battery, you can use the following code:

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { Device } = Plugins;

const getBatteryInfo = async () => {
  const batteryInfo = await Device.getBatteryInfo();
  console.log('Battery Level:', batteryInfo.percent);
  console.log('Is Charging?', batteryInfo.charging);
};
```

### Permission Handling
You can also check for permission statuses using this package. For example, to check camera permission:

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { Permissions } = Plugins;

const checkCameraPermission = async () => {
  const cameraPermission = await Permissions.query({ name: 'camera' });
  if (cameraPermission.granted) {
    console.log('Camera permission is granted.');
  } else {
    console.log('Camera permission is not granted.');
  }
};
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you learned how to integrate the `capacitor-detect-mobile-services` package into your Capacitor app to detect network availability, battery information, and handle permissions effectively. Start using this package to enhance your app's capabilities with mobile services detection.
