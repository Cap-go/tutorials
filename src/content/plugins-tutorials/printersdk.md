# Using the com.klispay.sdkprinter Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the com.klispay.sdkprinter package to print documents in your Android app.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following set up in your development environment:

- Android Studio
- Android SDK
- Kotlin or Java knowledge
- Basic understanding of Android app development

## Installation

To use the com.klispay.sdkprinter package in your Android app, follow these steps:

1. Open your app's build.gradle file.
2. Add the following dependency to the dependencies section:

   ```groovy
   implementation 'com.klispay:sdkprinter:1.0.0'
   ```

3. Sync your project with Gradle.

## Initializing the Printer SDK

Before using the com.klispay.sdkprinter package, you need to initialize the Printer SDK in your app. Follow these steps to do so:

1. Import the necessary classes:

   ```java
   import com.klispay.sdkprinter.PrinterSDK;
   import com.klispay.sdkprinter.PrinterSDKListener;
   ```

2. Initialize the PrinterSDK in your activity or fragment:

   ```java
   PrinterSDK.initialize(context, new PrinterSDKListener() {
       @Override
       public void onInitialized() {
           // Printer SDK initialized successfully
       }

       @Override
       public void onError(String error) {
           // Error occurred during initialization
       }
   });
   ```

3. Make sure to handle the initialization callbacks accordingly. You can display a toast message or show an error dialog based on the initialization status.

## Printing a Document

Once the Printer SDK is initialized, you can start printing documents in your app. Here's an example of how to print a document:

```java
PrinterSDK.printDocument(context, documentUri, new PrinterSDK.PrintCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onPrintStarted() {
        // Printing started
    }

    @Override
    public void onPrintCompleted() {
        // Printing completed successfully
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(String error) {
        // Error occurred during printing
    }
});
```

Make sure to replace `context` with the appropriate context object and `documentUri` with the URI of the document you want to print.
