# Using the hci-asr Package

The hci-asr package is a powerful tool for implementing speech recognition functionality in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) applications. In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps of installing and using the hci-asr package to perform speech recognition tasks.

## Installation

Before we can start using the hci-asr package, we need to install it. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the hci-asr package:

```bash
npm install hci-asr
```

## Usage

Once the hci-asr package is installed, we can begin using its features. Here's an example of how to use the package to perform speech recognition:

```javascript
const hciAsr = require('hci-asr');

// Create a new instance of the hci-asr recognizer
const recognizer = new hciAsr.Recognizer();

// Load a language model for speech recognition
recognizer.loadModel('english');

// Start the recognition process
recognizer.start();

// Process incoming audio data
// TODO: Add code for capturing audio data and passing it to the recognizer

// When finished, stop the recognition process
recognizer.stop();

// Get the recognized text
const recognizedText = recognizer.getRecognizedText();

console.log('Recognized Text:', recognizedText);
```

In this code snippet, we first create a new instance of the hci-asr Recognizer class. We then load a language model, in this case, the English language model. Next, we start the recognition process and process incoming audio data. Finally, we stop the recognition process and retrieve the recognized text.

## Conclusion

The hci-asr package provides a straightforward way to integrate speech recognition functionality into your HCI applications. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you should now have a basic understanding of how to install and use the hci-asr package.

Remember to refer to the package documentation for more advanced usage and customization options.

Now you're ready to enhance your HCI applications with powerful speech recognition capabilities using the hci-asr package!
