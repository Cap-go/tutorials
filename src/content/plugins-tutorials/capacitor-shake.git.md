I'm not sure about the specific details of using the `@capgo/capacitor-shake` package. You might want to refer to the official documentation or resources for a detailed tutorial.

For the frontmatter section in the markdown file containing the tutorial, it should look something like this:

```markdown
---
"title": "Using @capgo/capacitor-shake Package Tutorial"
"description": "This tutorial covers how to use @capgo/capacitor-shake package in your Capacitor project."
"created_at": "2022-09-13"
"published": true
"slug": "capacitor-shake.git"
---
```

Make sure to integrate this frontmatter at the beginning of your markdown file before starting the tutorial content.
