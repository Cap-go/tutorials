I don't have information on the `@capgo/capacitor-shake` package and its usage. It seems that the package name might be incorrect. I recommend checking the correct package name and official documentation for a tutorial on how to use it. Once you have the correct package name and details, feel free to ask for assistance in generating a Markdown tutorial with the specified frontmatter.
