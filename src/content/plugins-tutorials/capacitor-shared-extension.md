Sure! Here's a markdown tutorial on how to use the `capacitor-shared-extension` package:

## Installing the Package

To start using the `capacitor-shared-extension` package, you first need to install it. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install capacitor-shared-extension
```

## Importing the Package

Once the package is installed, you can import it in your code. In your JavaScript or TypeScript file, add the following line:

```javascript
import { SharedExtension } from 'capacitor-shared-extension';
```

## Using the Package

Now that you have imported the `SharedExtension` class, you can start using its methods. Here's an example of how to use the `share()` method to share a file:

```javascript
const sharedExtension = new SharedExtension();

// Share a file
sharedExtension.share({
  title: 'My File',
  fileUrl: 'https://example.com/myfile.pdf',
  mimeType: 'application/pdf'
})
  .then(() => {
    console.log('File shared successfully');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error sharing file: ', error);
  });
```

In the example above, we create a new instance of the `SharedExtension` class and call the `share()` method with an object containing the `title`, `fileUrl`, and `mimeType` of the file to be shared. The `share()` method returns a promise, so we can use `.then()` and `.catch()` to handle the success and error cases respectively.
