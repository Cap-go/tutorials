# Printing with Bluetooth using the Printv Package

The Printv package is a powerful tool that allows you to print documents using a Bluetooth printer. This tutorial will guide you through the installation process and show you how to use the package to print your documents. Let's get started!

## Installation

To use the Printv package, you need to install it in your project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install printv
npx cap sync
```

This command will install the Printv package and synchronize your project. 

## Importing the Package

Once the package is installed, you need to import it into your project. Add the following code at the top of your file:

```javascript
import { PrintV } from "printv";
```

This code imports the PrintV class from the Printv package, allowing you to use its methods.

## Printing a Document

To print a document using the Bluetooth printer, you need to follow the steps below:

1. Connect the printer to your device via Bluetooth.
2. Create a string containing the text you want to print. Use the defined tags to position the text as needed. For example:

```javascript
let textToPrint = "[L]\n" +
                  "[L] <b>bold text</b>\n\n" +
                  "[C] <b>I am a text in the center</b>\n" +
                  "[R] I am a text to the right\n" +
                  "[L] I am a text to the left\n" +
                  "[L] <b>inserting text</b>\n";
```

In the above code, the text is positioned to the left, center, and right using the tags [L], [C], and [R] respectively. Line breaks are denoted by "\n".

3. Pass the text to the `blPrint` method of the PrintV class and call it as shown below:

```javascript
PrintV.blPrint({ value: textToPrint });
```

This code sends the information to the printer for printing.

## Example

Here's a complete example that demonstrates how to use the Printv package to print a document using Bluetooth:

```javascript
import { PrintV } from "printv";

let textToPrint = "[L]\n" +
                  "[L] <b>bold text</b>\n\n" +
                  "[C] <b>I am a text in the center</b>\n" +
                  "[R] I am a text to the right\n" +
                  "[L] I am a text to the left\n" +
                  "[L] <b>inserting text</b>\n";

PrintV.blPrint({ value: textToPrint });
```

In this example, the text is positioned to the left, center, and right. The tags [L], [C], and [R] are used for positioning.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have learned how to use the Printv package to print documents using a Bluetooth printer. You now have the necessary knowledge to integrate printing functionality into your applications. Happy printing!
