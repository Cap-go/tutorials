# Using the phone-call-trap package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the phone-call-trap package to track and handle incoming and outgoing calls in your application.

## Installation

To install the phone-call-trap package, run the following command:

```shell
npm install phone-call-trap
```

## Usage

Import the phone-call-trap package in your application:

```javascript
import PhoneCallTrap from 'phone-call-trap';
```

### Track Incoming Calls

To track incoming calls, use the `startTrackingIncomingCalls` method:

```javascript
PhoneCallTrap.startTrackingIncomingCalls((incomingCall) => {
  console.log(`Incoming call from ${incomingCall.phoneNumber}`);
});
```

This will start tracking incoming calls and log the phone number of each incoming call.

### Track Outgoing Calls

To track outgoing calls, use the `startTrackingOutgoingCalls` method:

```javascript
PhoneCallTrap.startTrackingOutgoingCalls((outgoingCall) => {
  console.log(`Outgoing call to ${outgoingCall.phoneNumber}`);
});
```

This will start tracking outgoing calls and log the phone number of each outgoing call.

### Handle Incoming Calls

To handle incoming calls, use the `onIncomingCall` event:

```javascript
PhoneCallTrap.onIncomingCall((incomingCall) => {
  console.log(`Incoming call from ${incomingCall.phoneNumber}`);
  // Custom code to handle the incoming call
  // For example, display a notification or show a call screen
});
```

This allows you to perform custom actions when an incoming call is received.

### Handle Outgoing Calls

To handle outgoing calls, use the `onOutgoingCall` event:

```javascript
PhoneCallTrap.onOutgoingCall((outgoingCall) => {
  console.log(`Outgoing call to ${outgoingCall.phoneNumber}`);
  // Custom code to handle the outgoing call
  // For example, track call duration or record the call
});
```

This allows you to perform custom actions when an outgoing call is initiated.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to use the phone-call-trap package to track and handle incoming and outgoing calls in your application. You can now implement call tracking and call handling features in your app with ease using this package.
