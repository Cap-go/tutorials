I can help you with generating a markdown tutorial for using `@capacitor-community/firebase-crashlytics` package, but I don't have the capability to directly edit files or add front matter to files. You can follow these steps to do it manually:

1. Create a new markdown file or open the existing file you want to add this tutorial to.
2. Add the frontmatter at the beginning of the file with the desired key-value pairs. Make sure that the values are in double quotes and avoid any commas at the end of each key-value pair.
3. Write the tutorial content for using `@capacitor-community/firebase-crashlytics` package following the information provided in the context.

If you have any specific questions or need assistance with writing the tutorial content, feel free to ask!
