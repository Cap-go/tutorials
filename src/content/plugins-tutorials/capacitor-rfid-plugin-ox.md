# Using the capacitor-rfid-plugin-ox Package

In this tutorial, we will explore how to integrate the capacitor-rfid-plugin-ox package into your Capacitor app. The capacitor-rfid-plugin-ox package allows you to interact with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) functionality, enabling you to read and write RFID tags, manage tag data, and perform other related operations.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

1. Capacitor CLI and Capacitor Core installed globally:
   ```cmd
   npm install -g @capacitor/cli @capacitor/core
   ```

2. An existing Capacitor project set up. If you don't have one, create a new Capacitor project:
   ```cmd
   npx @capacitor/cli create your-app-name
   ```

3. An RFID-enabled device or emulator to test the plugin.

## Installation

To begin using the capacitor-rfid-plugin-ox package, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your Capacitor project directory:
   ```cmd
   cd your-app-name
   ```

2. Install the capacitor-rfid-plugin-ox package from npm:
   ```cmd
   npm install capacitor-rfid-plugin-ox
   ```

3. Sync your Capacitor project with the native platforms:
   ```cmd
   npx cap sync
   ```

## Usage

Once the package is installed and synced with the native platforms, you can start using the capacitor-rfid-plugin-ox functionality in your app.

### Importing the Plugin

In your TypeScript or JavaScript file, import the capacitor-rfid-plugin-ox package:
```ts
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
const { CapacitorRfidPlugin } = Plugins;
```

### Reading RFID Tags

To read RFID tags using the plugin, use the `readTags` method:
```ts
const tags = await CapacitorRfidPlugin.readTags();
console.log(tags);
```

The `readTags` method returns an array of RFID tag objects, representing the tags detected by the device's RFID reader.

### Writing RFID Tags

To write data to RFID tags, use the `writeTag` method:
```ts
const success = await CapacitorRfidPlugin.writeTag({ data: 'Hello RFID', securityKey: '12345678' });
if (success) {
  console.log('Tag write successful');
} else {
  console.log('Tag write failed');
}
```

The `writeTag` method accepts an object with the `data` property representing the data to be written to the tag, and the `securityKey` property representing the security key required for write operations.

### Managing RFID Tag Data

The capacitor-rfid-plugin-ox package provides various methods for managing RFID tag data, including reading and writing specific data blocks, locking and unlocking tags, and more. Refer to the plugin's documentation or API reference for detailed usage instructions.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to use the capacitor-rfid-plugin-ox package to add RFID functionality to your Capacitor app. You explored how to install the package, import the plugin, and perform basic RFID tag operations such as reading and writing. With the capacitor-rfid-plugin-ox package, you can easily integrate RFID capabilities into your Capacitor app and develop applications for a wide range of use cases.
