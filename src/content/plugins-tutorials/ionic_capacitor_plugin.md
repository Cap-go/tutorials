# Using the Chandra Camera Plugin in Ionic Capacitor

In this tutorial, we will explore how to integrate and use the Chandra Camera Plugin in an Ionic Capacitor project. The Chandra Camera Plugin provides a simple way to add camera functionality to your Ionic app, allowing users to take photos and videos.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- Ionic CLI installed globally
- Capacitor installed in your Ionic project

## Step 1: Installing the Chandra Camera Plugin

To begin, open your terminal and navigate to your Ionic Capacitor project directory. Run the following command to install the Chandra Camera Plugin:

```
npm install chandra_camera_plugin
```

## Step 2: Configuring the Plugin

Next, we need to configure the plugin for both iOS and Android platforms.

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, open your project in Xcode and navigate to the `Info.plist` file. Add the following two entries:

- `NSCameraUsageDescription`: Add a description of why your app needs access to the camera.
- `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`: Add a description of why your app needs access to the photo library.

Here's an example of how these entries should be added:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires camera access to take photos and videos.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the photo library to save captured media.</string>
```

### Android Configuration

For Android, open the `MainActivity.java` file located in `android/app/src/main/java/com/yourapp`. Import the Chandra Camera Plugin by adding the following line at the top of the file:

```java
import com.chandra.camera.ChandraCameraPlugin;
```

Next, add the plugin to the `initialize` method of the `MainActivity` class:

```java
public class MainActivity extends BridgeActivity {
  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    // Initializes the Bridge
    this.init(savedInstanceState, new ArrayList<Class<? extends Plugin>>() {{
      add(ChandraCameraPlugin.class); // Add this line to initialize the Chandra Camera Plugin
    }});
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Using the Chandra Camera Plugin

Now that the Chandra Camera Plugin is installed and configured, we can start using it in our Ionic Capacitor project.

First, import the plugin in the file where you want to use it:

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
const { ChandraCameraPlugin } = Plugins;
```

### Taking a Photo

To take a photo using the device's camera, use the `takePhoto` method provided by the Chandra Camera Plugin:

```typescript
ChandraCameraPlugin.takePhoto().then((result) => {
  // Handle the photo capture result
  console.log(result);
}).catch((error) => {
  // Handle any errors that occur
  console.error(error);
});
```

The `takePhoto` method returns a promise that resolves with the captured photo data, or rejects with an error if the capture fails.

### Recording a Video

To record a video using the device's camera, use the `recordVideo` method provided by the Chandra Camera Plugin:

```typescript
ChandraCameraPlugin.recordVideo().then((result) => {
  // Handle the video recording result
  console.log(result);
}).catch((error) => {
  // Handle any errors that occur
  console.error(error);
});
```

The `recordVideo` method returns a promise that resolves with the recorded video data, or rejects with an error if the recording fails.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to integrate and use the Chandra Camera Plugin in an Ionic Capacitor project. We covered the installation, configuration, and usage of the plugin, including taking photos and recording videos. You can now enhance your Ionic app by adding camera functionality with the help of the Chandra Camera Plugin.

Remember to refer to the official plugin documentation for more advanced usage and customization options. Happy coding!
