# Using capacitor-fancy-geo: A Markdown Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will explore how to integrate and use the `capacitor-fancy-geo` package in your Capacitor app.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Capacitor CLI
- Node.js and npm

## Step 1: Install capacitor-fancy-geo

Start by installing the `capacitor-fancy-geo` package in your Capacitor project:

```bash
npm install capacitor-fancy-geo
```

## Step 2: Configure capacitor-fancy-geo

Next, we need to configure `capacitor-fancy-geo` in your Capacitor project. Open the `capacitor.config.json` file in the root directory of your project and add the following:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "FancyGeo": {
      "apiKey": "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with your own Google Maps API key.

## Step 3: Import and initialize the plugin

Import the `FancyGeo` plugin in your project and initialize it:

```typescript
import { FancyGeo } from 'capacitor-fancy-geo';

const fancyGeo = new FancyGeo();
```

## Step 4: Use the plugin methods

Now you can start using the `capacitor-fancy-geo` plugin in your app. Here are some examples:

### Get current location

```typescript
const location = await fancyGeo.getCurrentPosition();

console.log('Current location:', location);
```

### Track user's location

```typescript
fancyGeo.startTracking({
  enableBackgroundMode: true,
  accuracy: 'high',
});
```

### Reverse geocoding

```typescript
const address = await fancyGeo.reverseGeocode({
  latitude: 37.7749,
  longitude: -122.4194,
});

console.log('Address:', address);
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to integrate and use the `capacitor-fancy-geo` package in a Capacitor app. We covered the installation process, configuration, and usage of the plugin's methods for getting the user's location and performing reverse geocoding. Now you can leverage the power of location-based features in your Capacitor app!

Happy coding!
