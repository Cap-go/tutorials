```javascript
// Import the cap-sensing-kit package
const capSensingKit = require('cap-sensing-kit');

// Initialize the cap-sensing-kit with your desired configuration
capSensingKit.init({
  sensitivity: 0.5,
  debounceTime: 100
});

// Enable touch sensing on a specific element
capSensingKit.enableTouch('#myButton');

// Listen for touch events
capSensingKit.onTouch('#myButton', (event) => {
  console.log(`Button touched! Touch strength: ${event.strength}`);
});

// Disable touch sensing
capSensingKit.disableTouch('#myButton');
```
