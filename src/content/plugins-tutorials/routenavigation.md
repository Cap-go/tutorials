# Using route-navigation Package

The route-navigation package is a powerful tool that enables seamless and efficient navigation in your React app. It integrates with popular routing libraries like React Router and provides a simple and intuitive API for managing navigation state and transitions.

In this tutorial, we will cover the following topics:

1. Installing and Setting Up route-navigation
2. Defining Routes
3. Navigating Between Routes
4. Passing Data Between Routes
5. Handling Navigation Events

## 1. Installing and Setting Up route-navigation

To get started with the route-navigation package, you need to install it as a dependency in your React project. Run the following command in your project directory:

```
npm install route-navigation
```

Once the installation is complete, you need to set up the route-navigation provider in your app's entry file. Here's an example of how to do it:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { RouteNavigationProvider } from 'route-navigation';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <RouteNavigationProvider>
      <App />
    </RouteNavigationProvider>
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## 2. Defining Routes

With route-navigation, you can define routes using the `Route` component provided by the package. The `Route` component works similarly to the `Route` component from React Router. Here's an example of how to define routes using route-navigation:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Route } from 'route-navigation';

import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';
import Contact from './Contact';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Route path="/" component={Home} />
      <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In the above example, we have three routes: the root route, the About route, and the Contact route. Each route is associated with a corresponding component.

## 3. Navigating Between Routes

To navigate between routes using route-navigation, you can use the `navigate` function provided by the package. The `navigate` function accepts the path of the desired route as an argument and triggers a navigation transition. Here's an example of how to navigate to a different route:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { navigate } from 'route-navigation';

const Home = () => {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    navigate('/about');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Home page!</h1>
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Go to About</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

In the above example, when the button is clicked, the `handleButtonClick` function is triggered, which calls the `navigate` function with the path '/about'. This causes a transition to the About route.

## 4. Passing Data Between Routes

route-navigation also provides a convenient way to pass data between routes using the `state` parameter in the `navigate` function. The `state` parameter allows you to pass arbitrary data along with the navigation transition. Here's an example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { navigate } from 'route-navigation';

const Home = () => {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    navigate('/about', { message: 'Hello from the Home page!' });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Home page!</h1>
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Go to About</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

In the above example, when the button is clicked, the `handleButtonClick` function is triggered, which calls the `navigate` function with the path '/about' and a `state` object containing a message. This allows the About route to access the passed data.

## 5. Handling Navigation Events

route-navigation provides various events that you can use to handle navigation events. These events include `willNavigate`, `didNavigate`, and `didUpdateState`. Here's an example of how to use the `willNavigate` event:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { navigate, useNavigationEvents } from 'route-navigation';

const Contact = () => {
  useNavigationEvent('willNavigate', (route, state) => {
    console.log(`Navigating to ${route} with state:`, state);
  });

  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    navigate('/');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Contact Page</h1>
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Go to Home</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Contact;
```

In the above example, the `useNavigationEvent` hook is used to listen for the `willNavigate` event. When the Contact route is about to navigate, the provided callback function is triggered, which logs the route and state information to the console.

That's it! You now know how to use the route-navigation package to implement navigation in your React app. Happy coding!
