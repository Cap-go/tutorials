# Using the Capacitor Bixolon Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to integrate and utilize the capacitor-bixolon package in your Capacitor app. The capacitor-bixolon package provides a simple and convenient way to interact with Bixolon printers in your mobile application.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- Capacitor CLI
- Bixolon printer and its SDK

## Installation

First, let's create a new Capacitor project if you haven't already:

```bash
npx @capacitor/cli create
```

Next, install the capacitor-bixolon package:

```bash
npm install capacitor-bixolon
```

## Integration with Capacitor

To integrate the capacitor-bixolon package with your Capacitor app, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules in your main `index.ts` file:

   ```typescript
   import { registerWebPlugin } from '@capacitor/core';
   import { CapacitorBixolon } from 'capacitor-bixolon';
   ```

2. Register the capacitor-bixolon plugin by calling `registerWebPlugin`:

   ```typescript
   registerWebPlugin(CapacitorBixolon);
   ```

3. Test the integration by printing a sample text:

   ```typescript
   import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

   const { CapacitorBixolon } = Plugins;

   await CapacitorBixolon.printText('Hello, Bixolon Printer!');
   ```

That's it! You have successfully integrated the capacitor-bixolon package with your Capacitor app.

## Usage
