# Using capacitor-blob-writer Package Tutorial

The capacitor-blob-writer package offers a faster and more stable alternative to @capacitor/filesystem's `Filesystem.writeFile` for writing Blobs to the filesystem in Capacitor apps. This tutorial will walk you through the process of writing Blobs to disk using this package and how to access the files afterwards.

## Writing with capacitor-blob-writer

To begin with, you need to have a Blob that you want to write to disk. This Blob could be a file downloaded from the internet or any binary data generated by your app.

```javascript
import { Directory } from "@capacitor/filesystem";
import { Capacitor } from "@capacitor/core";
import write_blob from "capacitor-blob-writer";

let my_video_blob = ...; // Your Blob here

write_blob({
    path: "media/videos/funny.mp4",
    directory: Directory.Data,
    blob: my_video_blob,
    fast_mode: true,
    recursive: true,
    on_fallback: (error) => {
        console.error(error);
    }
}).then(() => {
    console.log("Video written.");
});
```

## Reading Files with capacitor-blob-writer

Reading files written with capacitor-blob-writer involves accessing the file as a URL, especially on the web platform. Here's how you can stream a video file from disk using a `<video>` element:

```javascript
const video_element = document.createElement("video");
document.body.append(video_element);

if (Capacitor.getPlatform() === "web") {
    Filesystem.readFile({
        path: "media/videos/funny.mp4",
        directory: Directory.Data
    }).then(({ data }) => {
        const url = URL.createObjectURL(data);
        video_element.src = url;
    });
}
```

By following these steps, you can effectively write and access Blob files using the capacitor-blob-writer package in your Capacitor apps.
