# Using the Open Identity Package

The open-identity package provides a powerful set of tools for integrating identity management functionality into your application. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of using the open-identity package to authenticate users and manage their identities.

## Step 1: Installation

To get started, you will need to install the open-identity package in your project. You can do this by running the following command:

```terminal
npm install open-identity
```

## Step 2: Configuration

Once the package is installed, you will need to configure it with the necessary settings. This typically involves providing your application's client ID and redirect URI. 

```javascript
import openIdentity from 'open-identity';

openIdentity.configure({
  clientId: 'your-client-id',
  redirectUri: 'your-redirect-uri',
});
```

## Step 3: User Authentication

Now that the package is configured, you can start using it to authenticate users. The `openIdentity.login` method can be used to initiate the login process.

```javascript
openIdentity.login()
  .then((user) => {
    // User successfully logged in
    console.log(user);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Error occurred during login
    console.error(error);
  });
```

## Step 4: Accessing User Data

Once the user is authenticated, you can access their profile and other relevant data using the `openIdentity.getUser` method.

```javascript
const user = openIdentity.getUser();

console.log(user.name);
console.log(user.email);
console.log(user.profilePicture);
```

## Step 5: User Logout

To log out the user, simply call the `openIdentity.logout` method.

```javascript
openIdentity.logout()
  .then(() => {
    // User successfully logged out
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Error occurred during logout
    console.error(error);
  });
```

That's it! You have successfully integrated the open-identity package into your application. This package provides a seamless way to handle user authentication and identity management. Happy coding!
