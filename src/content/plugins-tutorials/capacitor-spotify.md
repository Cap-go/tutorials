# Using Capacitor Spotify Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to integrate the Capacitor Spotify package into your Capacitor app. The Capacitor Spotify package provides a set of plugins and methods that allow you to interact with the Spotify API in your app.

To get started, make sure you have Capacitor installed in your project. If not, you can install it globally by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @capacitor/cli
```

## Installing the Capacitor Spotify Package

Next, let's install the Capacitor Spotify package. Open a terminal in your project's root directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm install capacitor-spotify
```

## Configuring the Spotify API

Before we can start using the Capacitor Spotify package, we need to configure the Spotify API. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and create a new app.
2. Once you have created the app, copy the Client ID and Client Secret.
3. Open your Capacitor project and navigate to the `android/app/src/main/res/values` directory.
4. Inside this directory, create a new file named `spotify.xml` and paste the following code:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="spotify_client_id">YOUR_CLIENT_ID</string>
    <string name="spotify_client_secret">YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET</string>
    <string name="spotify_redirect_uri">YOUR_REDIRECT_URI</string>
</resources>
```

Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `YOUR_REDIRECT_URI` with the values you copied from the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

## Initializing the Capacitor Spotify Plugin

To use the Capacitor Spotify package in your app, you need to initialize the plugin in your project. Open your `src/app.tsx` file and add the following code:

```typescript
import { registerWebPlugin } from '@capacitor/core';
import { CapacitorSpotify } from 'capacitor-spotify';

registerWebPlugin(CapacitorSpotify);
```

## Using the Capacitor Spotify API

Now that we have everything set up, we can start using the Capacitor Spotify package in our app. Here are some examples of common use cases:

### Authenticating with Spotify

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { CapacitorSpotify } = Plugins;

// Authenticate with Spotify
const authenticate = async () => {
  try {
    const result = await CapacitorSpotify.authenticate();
    // Handle authentication result
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle authentication error
  }
};

authenticate();
```

### Playing a Spotify Track

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { CapacitorSpotify } = Plugins;

// Play a Spotify track
const playTrack = async (trackId: string) => {
  try {
    await CapacitorSpotify.play({ trackId });
    // Handle track playback
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle playback error
  }
};

playTrack('TRACK_ID');
```

These are just a few examples of what you can do with the Capacitor Spotify package. For a complete list of available methods and options, refer to the package's documentation.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to integrate the Capacitor Spotify package into your Capacitor app. You now have the knowledge to authenticate with Spotify, play tracks, and explore many other capabilities provided by the package. Happy coding!
