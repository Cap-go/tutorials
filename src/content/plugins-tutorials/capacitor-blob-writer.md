# Using capacitor-blob-writer Package

The capacitor-blob-writer package is a powerful tool for writing and reading Blobs in Capacitor. It provides a faster and more stable alternative to Capacitor's built-in Filesystem.writeFile method. In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of using capacitor-blob-writer to write and read Blobs in your Capacitor app.

## Installation

To get started, you will need to install the capacitor-blob-writer package. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install capacitor-blob-writer
```

## Writing a Blob

To write a Blob to the filesystem using capacitor-blob-writer, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules from the capacitor-blob-writer and @capacitor/filesystem packages:

```javascript
import { Directory } from "@capacitor/filesystem";
import { Capacitor } from "@capacitor/core";
import write_blob from "capacitor-blob-writer";
```

2. Obtain a Blob that you want to write. This could be a file downloaded from the internet or some binary data generated by your app.

```javascript
let myBlob = ...; // Your Blob object
```

3. Use the `write_blob` function to write the Blob to disk. This function takes an options object and returns a Promise that resolves once the file has been successfully written.

```javascript
write_blob({
  path: "my_folder/my_file.txt", // Specify the path where you want to write the file
  directory: Directory.Data, // Specify the directory in which the file should be written
  blob: myBlob, // Pass the Blob object
  recursive: true, // Set to true if you want to create intermediate directories
  on_fallback: (error) => {
    console.error(error);
  }, // Optional: Handle fallback mode errors
})
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Blob written successfully.");
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error writing Blob:", error);
  });
```

## Reading a Blob

To read a Blob from the filesystem using capacitor-blob-writer, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules from the capacitor-blob-writer and @capacitor/filesystem packages (if you haven't already):

```javascript
import { Directory } from "@capacitor/filesystem";
import { Capacitor } from "@capacitor/core";
import write_blob from "capacitor-blob-writer";
```

2. Use the `Filesystem.readFile` method from @capacitor/filesystem to read the file as a Blob:

```javascript
Filesystem.readFile({
  path: "my_folder/my_file.txt", // Specify the path of the file you want to read
  directory: Directory.Data, // Specify the directory from which to read the file
})
  .then(({ data }) => {
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(data); // Create a URL from the Blob data
    // Use the URL to display or manipulate the Blob as needed
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error reading Blob:", error);
  });
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to use the capacitor-blob-writer package to write and read Blobs in Capacitor. This package provides a faster and more stable alternative to Capacitor's built-in Filesystem.writeFile method. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you should now be able to effectively work with Blobs in your Capacitor app.
