# Using capacitor-lastphoto-plugin package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the capacitor-lastphoto-plugin package in your Capacitor project. The capacitor-lastphoto-plugin package allows you to access and retrieve the last photo taken or added to the device's photo library.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed and set up in your project:

- [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started)
- Capacitor project with a supported platform (iOS, Android, or Web)
- Latest version of capacitor-lastphoto-plugin

## Installation

To install the capacitor-lastphoto-plugin package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install capacitor-lastphoto-plugin
```

## Adding the Plugin to your Capacitor Project

Once the package is installed, you need to add the plugin to your Capacitor project. To do this, follow the steps below:

### 1. Generate the Plugin

Use the Capacitor CLI to generate the plugin:

```bash
npx cap plugin:generate
```

When prompted for the plugin details, provide the following information:

- Plugin npm name (kebab-case. ex: capacitor-plugin-example): capacitor-lastphoto-plugin
- Plugin id (domain-style syntax. ex: com.mycompany.plugins.example): com.example.lastphoto
- Plugin class name (ex: Example): LastPhoto
- Description: Access and retrieve the last photo taken or added to the device's photo library
- Git repository: <your-git-repository-url>
- Author: <your-name>
- License: MIT

### 2. Implement the Plugin

Next, implement the plugin functionality for each supported platform (iOS, Android, and Web) by following the respective guides:

- [Capacitor iOS Plugin Guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/plugins/ios)
- [Capacitor Android Plugin Guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/plugins/android)
- [Capacitor Web/PWA Plugin Guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/plugins/web)

## Using the Plugin

Once the plugin is implemented and added to your Capacitor project, you can use it in your code. Here's an example of how to use the capacitor-lastphoto-plugin package:

```typescript
import { Plugins } from "@capacitor/core";

const { LastPhoto } = Plugins;

async function getLastPhoto() {
  try {
    const result = await LastPhoto.getLastPhoto();
    console.log(result.path);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

In the above example, we import the `LastPhoto` plugin from the `@capacitor/core` package. We then define an asynchronous function `getLastPhoto()` to retrieve the last photo using the `getLastPhoto()` method provided by the `LastPhoto` plugin. The result contains the path of the last photo, which is then logged to the console.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the capacitor-lastphoto-plugin package to access and retrieve the last photo taken or added to the device's photo library. We covered the installation process, adding the plugin to your Capacitor project, implementing the plugin for each platform, and using the plugin in your code.

With this knowledge, you can now integrate the capacitor-lastphoto-plugin package into your Capacitor project and utilize its functionality to work with photos in your application.
