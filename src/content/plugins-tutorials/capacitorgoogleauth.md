# Using @greytch/capacitor-google-auth package

The @greytch/capacitor-google-auth package provides a convenient way to integrate Google authentication into your Capacitor projects. This tutorial will guide you through the installation process and show you how to authenticate a user using Google Sign-In.

## Installation

Before you can start using the @greytch/capacitor-google-auth package, you need to install it into your project. Follow these steps:

1. Open your project's terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to install the @greytch/capacitor-google-auth package:

   ```bash
   npm install @greytch/capacitor-google-auth
   ```

3. After the package is installed, update your Capacitor dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npx cap update
   ```

## Usage

Now that the @greytch/capacitor-google-auth package is installed in your project, you can start using it to authenticate users with Google Sign-In.

### The GoogleAuth.initialize() Method

The first step is to initialize the GoogleAuth plugin. This method sets up the necessary configurations for Google authentication. Here's how you can initialize the plugin:

```javascript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
const { GoogleAuth } = Plugins;

// Initialize the GoogleAuth plugin
GoogleAuth.initialize({
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com',
  scopes: ['profile', 'email'],
});
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your actual Google client ID obtained from the Google Developers Console.

### The GoogleAuth.signIn() Method

With the GoogleAuth plugin initialized, you can now use the `signIn()` method to authenticate a user with Google Sign-In. This method opens a Google Sign-In dialog and returns a user object if the authentication is successful. Here's an example of how to use the `signIn()` method:

```javascript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
const { GoogleAuth } = Plugins;

async function signInWithGoogle() {
  try {
    const user = await GoogleAuth.signIn();
    console.log('User authenticated:', user);
    // Perform further actions with the authenticated user
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Authentication failed:', error);
  }
}
```

The `signIn()` method returns a user object that contains information about the authenticated user, such as the user's name, email, and profile picture.

## Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to install and use the @greytch/capacitor-google-auth package in your Capacitor projects. You initialized the plugin using the `GoogleAuth.initialize()` method and authenticated a user using the `GoogleAuth.signIn()` method. With this knowledge, you can now easily implement Google Sign-In functionality in your Capacitor apps.

You can find more information about the @greytch/capacitor-google-auth package in the official documentation.

Remember to handle any errors that may occur during the authentication process and provide a smooth login experience for your users. Happy coding!
