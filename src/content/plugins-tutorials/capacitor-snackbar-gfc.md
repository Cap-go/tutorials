### Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the capacitor-snackbar-gfc package in your Android app. The capacitor-snackbar-gfc package provides functionality for displaying snackbars in your app.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Step 1: Installation

To start using the capacitor-snackbar-gfc package, you need to install it in your project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install capacitor-snackbar-gfc
```

### Step 2: Importing the Package

Next, you need to import the capacitor-snackbar-gfc package in your project. Open your desired component file and add the following import statement at the top:

```javascript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
const { SnackBarGFC } = Plugins;
```

### Step 3: Displaying a Snackbar

Now that you have imported the capacitor-snackbar-gfc package, you can use its `show()` method to display a snackbar in your app. Here's an example:

```javascript
SnackBarGFC.show({
  message: 'Hello, Snackbar!',
  duration: 'long'
});
```

In the above code, we are calling the `show()` method of the `SnackBarGFC` plugin and passing an object with the `message` and `duration` properties. The `message` property contains the text to be displayed in the snackbar, and the `duration` property specifies how long the snackbar should be visible.

### Step 4: Customizing the Snackbar

The capacitor-snackbar-gfc package provides additional options to customize the snackbar. Here are some examples:

- Changing the background color:

```javascript
SnackBarGFC.show({
  message: 'Custom Snackbar',
  duration: 'short',
  backgroundColor: '#FF0000'
});
```

- Adding an action button:

```javascript
SnackBarGFC.show({
  message: 'Snackbar with Action',
  duration: 'short',
  actionText: 'Undo',
  actionTextColor: '#FFFFFF',
  actionHandler: () => {
    // Handle action button click
  }
});
```
