## Install

To get started with the capacitor-file-chunk package, follow the installation steps below:

```bash
npm install capacitor-file-chunk
npx cap sync
```

## Install Android

To configure the capacitor-file-chunk package for Android, you need to make a few modifications in your project.

1. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file and allow localhost traffic by adding the following line within the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<application
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
    ...
```

2. In your project's `build.gradle` file, add the capacitor-file-chunk library to the dependencies section:

```gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.github.joshjdevl.libsodiumjni:libsodium-jni-aar:2.0.1'
}
```

3. Fix the `allowBackup` warning by adding `xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"` and `tools:replace="android:allowBackup"` to your Manifest:

```xml
<!-- AndroidManifest.xml -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
          xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
          package="com.name.myapp">
    <application
        ...
        tools:replace="android:allowBackup">
        <activity android:name=".MainActivity">
        ...
        </activity>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

## Install iOS

To configure the capacitor-file-chunk package for iOS, follow the steps below:

1. Open your project's `Info.plist` file and add the following lines to allow localhost:

```
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

By completing these installation steps, you are now ready to use the capacitor-file-chunk package in your Capacitor applications.

## Demo

Before diving into the usage details, it's recommended to explore the [demonstration project](https://github.com/example-user/capacitor-file-chunk-demo) showcasing how to utilize the capacitor-file-chunk package in a real-world scenario. This demo project will give you a better understanding of the package's features and functionality.

## Usage

The capacitor-file-chunk package provides a set of methods that allow you to efficiently read and write large files in Capacitor applications. Let's go through the key steps involved in using this package.

### 1. Create the FileChunkManager

To start using the capacitor-file-chunk package, you first need to create an instance of the `FileChunkManager` class. This class provides the main functionality for handling chunked file operations.

```javascript
import { FileChunkManager } from 'capacitor-file-chunk';

const fileChunkManager = new FileChunkManager();
```

### 2. Start the server

Before performing any read or write operations, you need to start the local server provided by the capacitor-file-chunk package. This server enables direct communication with your application and handles the exchange of binary data.

```javascript
await fileChunkManager.startServer();
```

### 3. Create an empty file

If you want to write data to a new file, you can create an empty file using the `createEmptyFile` method.

```javascript
const filePath = '/path/to/file.txt';
await fileChunkManager.createEmptyFile(filePath);
```

### 4. Write to a file

To write data to a file, you can utilize the `writeToFile` method. This method allows you to specify the chunk size and the data to be written.

```javascript
const chunkSize = 1024; // Define your preferred chunk size
const data = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.';
await fileChunkManager.writeToFile(filePath, chunkSize, data);
```

### 5. Check the file size

You can check the size of a file using the `getFileSize` method.

```javascript
const fileSize = await fileChunkManager.getFileSize(filePath);
console.log(`File size: ${fileSize} bytes`);
```

### 6. Read from the file

To read data from a file, you can use the `readFromFile` method. This method allows you to specify the chunk size and retrieve the data in chunks.

```javascript
const readData = await fileChunkManager.readFromFile(filePath, chunkSize);
console.log(readData);
```

### 7. Stop the server

Once you have completed your file operations, it's important to stop the local server using the `stopServer` method.

```javascript
await fileChunkManager.stopServer();
```

## Usage Examples

Here are a few additional usage examples to demonstrate the versatility of the capacitor-file-chunk package:

- **Uploading a large file:** You can use the capacitor-file-chunk package to upload large files to a remote server in smaller chunks, ensuring a more stable and reliable upload process.

- **Downloading a large file:** Similarly, you can download large files from a remote server in smaller chunks, providing more efficient transfer and better error handling.

- **Encrypting and decrypting files:** The package's encryption capabilities allow you to encrypt files before storing them locally or transmitting them over a network. You can then decrypt the files when needed.

These are just a few examples of how the capacitor-file-chunk package can be used in various file management scenarios, providing better performance and enhanced security.

## Benchmarking

If performance benchmarking is an important factor for your application, you can utilize the capacitor-file-chunk package to measure and compare the performance of reading and writing large files. By adjusting the chunk size and analyzing the read and write times, you can fine-tune your application to achieve optimal results.

## Security

The capacitor-file-chunk package adds an extra layer of security to your file operations. By operating on a localhost server, it reduces the risk of data interception or malicious attacks. Additionally, the package incorporates encryption capabilities, allowing you to encrypt sensitive files and protect them from unauthorized access.

It's important to note that while the capacitor-file-chunk package provides security features, it does not manage file permissions. It is your responsibility to handle file permissions properly within your application to ensure appropriate file access.

## Final Thoughts

The capacitor-file-chunk package offers an efficient and secure solution for reading and writing large files in Capacitor applications. By overcoming the limitations of the Capacitor Filesystem plugin and eliminating the need for base64 conversion, this package provides a streamlined and performance-oriented approach to file handling.
