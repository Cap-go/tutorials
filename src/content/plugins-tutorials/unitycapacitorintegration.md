# Tutorial: Using unity-capacitor-integration Package

---

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `unity-capacitor-integration` package to integrate Unity projects with Capacitor. This package allows you to seamlessly incorporate Unity games or interactive experiences into Capacitor-powered mobile apps.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, please ensure the following:

- You have a basic understanding of Unity development.
- You have Capacitor and its dependencies installed. If not, you can follow the [official Capacitor installation guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started).
- You have a Unity project ready that you want to integrate with Capacitor.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps to install the `unity-capacitor-integration` package:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your Capacitor project's root directory.
3. Run the following command to install the package:

   ```bash
   npm install unity-capacitor-integration
   ```

## Unity Project Configuration

Before integrating your Unity project with Capacitor, you need to perform some configuration steps in your Unity project. Here's what you need to do:

1. Open your Unity project.
2. Go to **File > Build Settings** to open the build settings window.
3. Select your target platform (e.g., Android or iOS) and make necessary platform-specific settings.
4. Under the **Player Settings** section, ensure you have the following configurations:

   - **Product Name**: Set a meaningful name for your Unity project.
   - **Company Name**: Enter your company or organization name.
   - **Resolution and Presentation**: Configure the desired resolution and presentation settings for your Unity project.

5. Save your player settings and close the build settings window.

## Unity-Capacitor Integration

Now that your Unity project is properly configured, let's integrate it with Capacitor using the `unity-capacitor-integration` package. Follow these steps:

1. In your Capacitor project, open the `capacitor.config.json` file.
2. Locate the `plugins` section in the JSON configuration.
3. Add the following entry to the `plugins` section:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "UnityCapacitorIntegration",
     "package": "com.package.unity",
     "appId": "your.app.id"
   }
   ```

   Make sure to replace `"com.package.unity"` with the package name of your Unity project and `"your.app.id"` with the app ID or bundle identifier of your Capacitor project.

4. Save the changes made to the `capacitor.config.json` file.

## Usage

At this point, you have successfully integrated your Unity project with Capacitor. To use the Unity project in your Capacitor app, follow these steps:

1. Build your Unity project for the target platform you configured earlier (e.g., Android or iOS).
2. Copy the generated build files (e.g., APK for Android or Xcode project for iOS) into your Capacitor project's native platform-specific folders (`android/app` for Android or `ios/App` for iOS).
3. In your Capacitor project, call the `loadUnity()` function from the `unity-capacitor-integration` package to load the Unity project.

   ```javascript
   import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
   const { UnityCapacitorIntegration } = Plugins;

   UnityCapacitorIntegration.loadUnity();
   ```

4. Run your Capacitor project on the target platform to see the integrated Unity project in action.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have learned how to use the `unity-capacitor-integration` package to seamlessly integrate Unity projects with Capacitor. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can create powerful mobile apps that combine the interactive capabilities of Unity with the versatility of Capacitor.

Happy coding and have fun building amazing mobile experiences!
