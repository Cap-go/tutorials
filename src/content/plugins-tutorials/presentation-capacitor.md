## Installation

To get started, you need to install the presentation-capacitor package:

```bash
npm install presentation-capacitor
```

---

## Creating Slides

Once you have the package installed, import it into your project and start creating your slides. The presentation-capacitor package allows you to define slides as HTML templates. Here's an example of creating a simple slide:

```typescript
import { defineSlide } from 'presentation-capacitor';

defineSlide('my-slide', `
  <h1>Welcome to my presentation!</h1>
  <p>This is an example slide created using presentation-capacitor.</p>
`);
```

You can define multiple slides by calling the `defineSlide` function multiple times with different slide names and templates.

## Adding Animations and Interactivity

The presentation-capacitor package provides various methods and classes to add animations and interactivity to your slides. You can animate elements, control the slide transitions, and handle user interactions.

Here's an example of animating an element on a slide:

```typescript
import { animate, fade } from 'presentation-capacitor';

animate('.my-element', fade('in'));
```

In this example, the `fade` animation is applied to the element with the class `.my-element` to make it fade in.

You can also control slide transitions using the `navigate` method:

```typescript
import { navigate } from 'presentation-capacitor';

navigate('next');
```

The `navigate` method allows you to navigate to the next or previous slide.
