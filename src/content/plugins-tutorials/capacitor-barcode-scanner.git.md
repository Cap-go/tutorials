# Using @capacitor/barcode-scanner Package Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of integrating and using the @capacitor/barcode-scanner package to scan barcodes in a Capacitor application.

## Installation

To install the @capacitor/barcode-scanner package, run the following command in your Capacitor project:

```shell
npm install @capacitor/barcode-scanner
npx cap sync
```

### Android

For Android, make sure to request camera permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml file.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure to add the necessary permissions in the Info.plist file.

## Usage

To use the barcode scanner in your Capacitor application, follow these steps:

1. Import the barcode scanner plugin:

```javascript
import { BarcodeScanner } from '@capacitor/barcode-scanner';
```

2. Implement a function to scan a barcode:

```javascript
const scanBarcode = async () => {
    const result = await BarcodeScanner.scan();
    console.log('Scanned data:', result);
}
```

3. Call the `scanBarcode` function where you want to trigger the scan.

```javascript
scanBarcode();
```

By following these steps, you can easily integrate and utilize the @capacitor/barcode-scanner package in your Capacitor application for scanning barcodes.
