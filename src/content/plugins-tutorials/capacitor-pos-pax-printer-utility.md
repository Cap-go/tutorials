## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the @ticketplushq/capacitor-pos-pax-printer-utility package to handle POS printers in a Capacitor app. This package provides a seamless integration between Capacitor and POS printers, allowing you to easily print receipts and other documents from your app.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Capacitor installed in your project: [Capacitor installation guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/v3/getting-started/installation)

2. The @ticketplushq/capacitor-pos-pax-printer-utility package installed in your project:
```bash
npm install @ticketplushq/capacitor-pos-pax-printer-utility
```

## Step 1: Initialize the Plugin

To start using the POS printer utility, you need to initialize the plugin in your Capacitor app. Open your `capacitor.config.json` file and add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "CapacitorPOS": {
      "packageName": "@ticketplushq/capacitor-pos-pax-printer-utility"
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Connect to the Printer

Before printing any documents, you need to establish a connection with the POS printer. Use the `connect` function provided by the plugin to connect to the printer:

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { CapacitorPOS } = Plugins;

async function connectToPrinter() {
  try {
    const connectionResult = await CapacitorPOS.connect();
    if (connectionResult.connected) {
      console.log('Successfully connected to the printer!');
    } else {
      console.log('Failed to connect to the printer.');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error connecting to the printer:', error);
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Print a Receipt

Once the printer is connected, you can use the `print` function to print a receipt. The `print` function expects a string as the content of the receipt:

```typescript
async function printReceipt() {
  const receiptContent = 'Sample Receipt Content';

  try {
    await CapacitorPOS.print(receiptContent);
    console.log('Receipt printed successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error printing receipt:', error);
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Disconnect from the Printer

After you have finished printing, it is important to disconnect from the printer to free up system resources. Use the `disconnect` function to disconnect from the printer:

```typescript
async function disconnectFromPrinter() {
  try {
    await CapacitorPOS.disconnect();
    console.log('Successfully disconnected from the printer!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error disconnecting from the printer:', error);
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the @ticketplushq/capacitor-pos-pax-printer-utility package to handle POS printers in a Capacitor app. We covered the steps to initialize the plugin, connect to the printer, print a receipt, and disconnect from the printer. With this knowledge, you can easily integrate POS printing functionality into your Capacitor app.

Remember to refer to the official documentation of the @ticketplushq/capacitor-pos-pax-printer-utility package for more advanced features and configuration options.

Happy printing!
