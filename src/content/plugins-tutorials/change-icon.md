# Using the @arodebaugh/change-icon Package

The `@arodebaugh/change-icon` package provides a simple and straightforward solution for dynamically changing app icons. This tutorial will guide you through the installation and usage of this package.

## Installation

To install the `@arodebaugh/change-icon` package, open your terminal/command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
npm install @arodebaugh/change-icon
```

## Usage

Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your code. Here's an example of how to use the `changeAppIcon` function provided by the package:

```javascript
import { changeAppIcon } from "@arodebaugh/change-icon";

// Define the name and path of the new app icon
const newIcon = {
  name: "new-icon", // The name of the new app icon
  path: "/path/to/new-icon.png" // The file path of the new app icon
};

// Change the app icon to the new icon
changeAppIcon(newIcon)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("App icon changed successfully!");
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Failed to change app icon:", error);
  });
```

In the example above, we import the `changeAppIcon` function from the `@arodebaugh/change-icon` package. We then define the name and path of the new app icon and call the `changeAppIcon` function with the new icon object as an argument. The function returns a promise, so we can use `.then()` and `.catch()` to handle the success and error cases, respectively.

Remember to replace `"/path/to/new-icon.png"` with the actual file path of your new app icon.

And that's it! You have now implemented dynamic app icon changing using the `@arodebaugh/change-icon` package.
