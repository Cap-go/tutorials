## Using Capacitor Plugin Camera

### 1. Installation

First, install the capacitor-plugin-camera package in your Ionic project:

```bash
npm install capacitor-plugin-camera
```

### 2. Importing the Plugin

Import the camera plugin in your code:

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
const { Camera } = Plugins;
```

### 3. Taking a Picture

To take a picture with the camera, you can use the `getPhoto` method. Here's an example:

```typescript
const image = await Camera.getPhoto({
  quality: 90,
  allowEditing: true,
});
```

### 4. Configuring Camera Options

You can customize the camera options by passing in different parameters to the `getPhoto` method. Some common options include `quality`, `allowEditing`, `resultType`, and more.

### 5. Handling the Result

After taking a picture with the camera, you can handle the result accordingly. For example, you can display the image in your app or upload it to a server.

```typescript
const imageUrl = image.webPath;
```

### 6. Displaying the Image

You can display the captured image in your Ionic app using an `<img>` tag with the `src` attribute set to the `webPath` from the camera result.

```html
<img [src]="imageUrl" />
```

### 7. Error Handling

Make sure to handle any errors that might occur during the camera usage to provide a smooth user experience.

```typescript
try {
  const image = await Camera.getPhoto();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error taking picture', error);
}
```
