# Using the Capacitor-FreeRasp Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to integrate the Capacitor-FreeRasp package into your Capacitor project. The Capacitor-FreeRasp package allows you to easily connect and interact with Freerasp devices in your mobile applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- Capacitor installed globally
- A Capacitor project set up and initialized

If you haven't installed Capacitor yet, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @capacitor/cli
```

## Installation

To start using the Capacitor-FreeRasp package in your project, follow these steps:

1. Install the package using npm:

```bash
npm install capacitor-freerasp
```

2. Add the plugin to your Capacitor project:

```bash
npx cap add freerasp
```

3. Sync the native platforms:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the Capacitor-FreeRasp package and added the plugin to your project, you can start using it to interact with Freerasp devices. Here's a basic example:

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { FreeRasp } = Plugins;

async function connectToDevice() {
  try {
    const device = await FreeRasp.connect('your-device-id');
    console.log('Connected to device:', device);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to connect to device:', error);
  }
}
```

In the example above, we import the `FreeRasp` plugin from the `@capacitor/core` package and use the `connect` method to establish a connection with a Freerasp device using its ID. The `connect` method returns a promise that resolves to the connected device object.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to integrate the Capacitor-FreeRasp package into your Capacitor project and use it to connect with Freerasp devices. You can now start exploring the various features and capabilities of the package to build powerful mobile applications that interact with Freerasp devices.

Remember to refer to the official documentation of the Capacitor-FreeRasp package for more detailed information on its usage and available methods. Happy coding!
