# Using @dutchconcepts/capacitor-barcode-scanner Package

The @dutchconcepts/capacitor-barcode-scanner package is a fast and efficient QR barcode scanner library for Capacitor.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps to install the package:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your Capacitor project's root directory.
2. Run the following command to install the package:

   ```shell
   npm install @dutchconcepts/capacitor-barcode-scanner
   ```

3. After the installation is complete, sync your Capacitor project:

   ```shell
   npx cap sync
   ```

## Configuration

### iOS

No further steps are needed for iOS.

### Android

To configure the package for Android, you'll need to register the plugin in your main activity file:

1. Open your Android project in your preferred code editor.
2. Locate your main activity file (usually named MainActivity.java) in the following path: `src/main/java/[your-app-id]/MainActivity.java`
3. Import the `BarcodeScanner` class from the package:

   ```java
   import com.dutchconcepts.capacitor.barcodescanner.BarcodeScanner;
   ```

4. Register the plugin in the `onCreate` method of your main activity:

   ```java
   public class MainActivity extends BridgeActivity {
   
     @Override
     public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
   
       // Register the BarcodeScanner plugin
       registerPlugin(BarcodeScanner.class);
     }
   
     // ...
   }
   ```

## Usage

Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using the barcode scanner in your Capacitor project.

Here's an example of how to use the barcode scanner in your JavaScript code:

```javascript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { BarcodeScanner } = Plugins;

async function scanBarcode() {
  try {
    const result = await BarcodeScanner.scan();
    
    if (result.hasContent) {
      // Barcode scanned successfully
      console.log('Scanned barcode content:', result.content);
    } else {
      // Barcode scanning canceled
      console.log('Barcode scanning canceled');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // An error occurred while scanning barcode
    console.error('Barcode scanning error:', error);
  }
}
```

In the above example, we import the `BarcodeScanner` plugin from the `@capacitor/core` package and use the `scan` method to initiate the barcode scanning process. The `scan` method returns a result object containing the scanned barcode content.
