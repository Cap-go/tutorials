# Using the capacitor-plugin-smartdiet Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the capacitor-plugin-smartdiet package to track our diet and nutrition. The capacitor-plugin-smartdiet package provides various methods and functionalities to help us monitor our food intake, count calories, and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

## Installation

Before we can start using the capacitor-plugin-smartdiet package, we need to install it and add it to our Capacitor project.

1. Install Capacitor to the global scope by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
   ```

2. Generate a new Capacitor plugin for the SmartDiet package:

   ```bash
   npx cap plugin:generate
   ```

   Answer the prompts as follows:

   - Plugin npm name: `capacitor-plugin-smartdiet`
   - Plugin id: `com.example.smartdiet`
   - Plugin class name: `SmartDiet`
   - Description: "A plugin for tracking diet and nutrition"
   - Git repository: [https://github.com/example/capacitor-plugin-smartdiet.git](https://github.com/example/capacitor-plugin-smartdiet.git)
   - Author: "Your Name"
   - License: "MIT"

   This will generate the necessary files and dependencies for the capacitor-plugin-smartdiet package.

3. Link the capacitor-plugin-smartdiet package to your Capacitor project:

   ```bash
   npx cap sync
   ```

   This will update your Capacitor project with the plugin's files and configurations.

4. Install the capacitor-plugin-smartdiet package in your Ionic project:

   ```bash
   npm install capacitor-plugin-smartdiet
   ```

   This will add the package as a dependency to your project.

## Usage

Now that we have installed the capacitor-plugin-smartdiet package, we can start using its functionalities in our app.

1. Import the SmartDiet plugin into your component file:

   ```typescript
   import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

   const { SmartDiet } = Plugins;
   ```

2. Use the available methods provided by the SmartDiet plugin to track the diet and nutrition:

   - `trackFoodConsumption(food: string, calories: number)`: Use this method to track the consumption of a particular food item. Provide the name of the food and the number of calories consumed as parameters.

   - `getCalorieCount(): Promise<{ count: number }>`: Use this method to get the total calorie count for the day.

   - `getDailyNutrition(): Promise<{ nutrition: any[] }>`: Use this method to get the daily nutrition breakdown, including calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fats.

3. Implement the required functionality in your app based on the above methods. For example, you can create buttons to track food consumption and display the calorie count and nutrition breakdown.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { SmartDiet } = Plugins;

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: 'home.page.html',
  styleUrls: ['home.page.scss'],
})
export class HomePage {

  constructor() {}

  async trackFoodConsumption(food: string, calories: number) {
    await SmartDiet.trackFoodConsumption(food, calories);
  }

  async getCalorieCount() {
    const result = await SmartDiet.getCalorieCount();
    console.log('Total calorie count:', result.count);
  }

  async getDailyNutrition() {
    const result = await SmartDiet.getDailyNutrition();
    console.log('Daily nutrition:', result.nutrition);
  }
}
```

With these implemented functionalities, you can now track your food consumption, count calories, and retrieve daily nutrition information using the capacitor-plugin-smartdiet package.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to install and use the capacitor-plugin-smartdiet package to track our diet and nutrition. The package provides useful methods to help us monitor our food intake, count calories, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. By integrating this plugin into our Capacitor project, we can easily implement diet tracking features in our Ionic app.
