# Tutorial: Using @falconeta/capacitor-aws-amplify Package

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `@falconeta/capacitor-aws-amplify` package in your Capacitor project. This package provides integration with the AWS Amplify library, allowing you to easily add services such as authentication, storage, and API calls to your app.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Capacitor CLI: `npm install -g @capacitor/cli`
- AWS Amplify CLI: `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`

## Step 1: Create a new Capacitor Project

If you haven't already, create a new Capacitor project using the following command:

```bash
npx @capacitor/create-app
```

Follow the prompts to set up your project.

## Step 2: Install @falconeta/capacitor-aws-amplify Package

To install the `@falconeta/capacitor-aws-amplify` package, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install @falconeta/capacitor-aws-amplify
```

## Step 3: Configure AWS Amplify

Before we can use the package, we need to configure AWS Amplify. Run the following command to initialize Amplify in your project:

```bash
amplify init
```

Follow the prompts to set up your AWS Amplify project. Make sure to select the appropriate AWS region and provide your AWS credentials.

## Step 4: Add Capacitor Plugin

Next, we need to add the `@falconeta/capacitor-aws-amplify` plugin to our Capacitor project. Run the following command:

```bash
npx cap plugin add @falconeta/capacitor-aws-amplify
```

This will add the necessary Capacitor plugins for working with AWS Amplify.

## Step 5: Use @falconeta/capacitor-aws-amplify Package

Now that everything is set up, you can start using the `@falconeta/capacitor-aws-amplify` package in your project. Here are a few examples of what you can do:

### Authentication

```typescript
import { Auth } from '@falconeta/capacitor-aws-amplify';

// Sign up a new user
await Auth.signUp({
  username: 'john.doe@example.com',
  password: 'password123'
});

// Sign in an existing user
await Auth.signIn({
  username: 'john.doe@example.com',
  password: 'password123'
});

// Sign out the current user
await Auth.signOut();
```

### Storage

```typescript
import { Storage } from '@falconeta/capacitor-aws-amplify';

// Upload a file to S3 bucket
await Storage.put({
  key: 'my-file.txt',
  path: 'path/to/my-file.txt'
});

// Get the URL of a file in the S3 bucket
const url = await Storage.get({
  key: 'my-file.txt'
});

console.log(url);
```

### API

```typescript
import { API } from '@falconeta/capacitor-aws-amplify';

// Make a GET request to an API endpoint
const response = await API.get({
  path: '/users',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <access-token>'
  }
});

console.log(response.data);
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to set up and use the `@falconeta/capacitor-aws-amplify` package in a Capacitor project. We covered authentication, storage, and API usage examples. Now you can leverage the power of AWS Amplify in your Capacitor app!
