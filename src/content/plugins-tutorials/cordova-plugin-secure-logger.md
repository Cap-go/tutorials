# Using cordova-plugin-secure-logger

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the cordova-plugin-secure-logger package to implement secure logging in Cordova applications. The cordova-plugin-secure-logger provides a secure way to log sensitive information without exposing it in the system logs. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Install the Plugin

To begin, we need to install the cordova-plugin-secure-logger package. Open your terminal and navigate to your Cordova project directory. Run the following command to install the plugin:

```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-secure-logger
```

This will download and install the plugin in your project.

## Step 2: Initialize the Logger

In order to use the secure logger, we need to initialize it in our application code. Open your main JavaScript file or the file where you want to use the logger. Add the following code at the beginning of the file:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);

function onDeviceReady() {
  window.SecureLogger.init('YOUR_LOGGING_KEY');
}
```

Replace `YOUR_LOGGING_KEY` with your own logging key. This key will be used to encrypt the logged data.

## Step 3: Logging Secure Data

Now that we have initialized the logger, we can start logging secure data. To log a message, use the following code:

```javascript
window.SecureLogger.log('This is a secure log message.');
```

This will log the message using the secure logger, encrypting the message with the provided logging key.

## Step 4: Retrieving Secure Logs

To retrieve the secure logs, you can use the following code:

```javascript
window.SecureLogger.getAllLogs(function(logs) {
  console.log(logs);
});
```

This will retrieve all the secure logs and log them to the console.

## Step 5: Clearing Secure Logs

If you want to clear the secure logs, you can use the following code:

```javascript
window.SecureLogger.clearLogs();
```

This will clear all the secure logs stored by the logger.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the cordova-plugin-secure-logger package to implement secure logging in Cordova applications. We covered the steps to install the plugin, initialize the logger, log secure data, retrieve secure logs, and clear secure logs. By using the cordova-plugin-secure-logger, you can securely log sensitive information in your Cordova applications.

I hope you found this tutorial helpful. Happy coding!
