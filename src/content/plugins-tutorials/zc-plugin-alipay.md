# zc-plugin-alipay Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of incorporating the zc-plugin-alipay package into your Capacitor project. The zc-plugin-alipay package allows you to integrate Alipay functionality into your mobile application.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed and set up:

- Capacitor
- Alipay developer account

## Step 1: Install the Plugin

To start using the zc-plugin-alipay package, you need to install it in your Capacitor project. Open your project directory in the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install zc-plugin-alipay
```

This will install the package and its dependencies in your project.

## Step 2: Configure the Plugin

Once the installation is complete, you need to configure the plugin with your Alipay credentials. Open your `capacitor.config.json` file and add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "zc-plugin-alipay": {
      "appId": "YOUR_ALIPAY_APP_ID",
      "appPrivateKey": "YOUR_ALIPAY_APP_PRIVATE_KEY",
      "alipayPublicKey": "YOUR_ALIPAY_PUBLIC_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_ALIPAY_APP_ID`, `YOUR_ALIPAY_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `YOUR_ALIPAY_PUBLIC_KEY` with your actual Alipay credentials.

## Step 3: Import and Use the Plugin

Now that the plugin is installed and configured, you can import it into your project and start using its functionality. Here's an example of how to import and use the plugin:

```javascript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { ZCPluginAlipay } = Plugins;

// Example usage: make a payment
ZCPluginAlipay.pay({ amount: 10, subject: 'Test Payment', body: 'This is a test payment.' })
  .then(paymentResult => {
    console.log(paymentResult);
    // Handle payment result
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
    // Handle error
  });
```

In this example, we import the `ZCPluginAlipay` object from the `@capacitor/core` package. We then call the `pay` method with the necessary payment details. The `pay` method returns a promise, so you can handle the payment result or any errors that occur.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated the zc-plugin-alipay package into your Capacitor project. You can now leverage the Alipay functionality in your mobile application.

Remember to refer to the package documentation for more advanced usage and additional configuration options. Happy coding!
