# Using capacitor-exit-app-ios Package Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through using the `capacitor-exit-app-ios` package to force quit an app on iOS using Capacitor.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have access to `capacitor-exit-app-ios` package. You can follow the installation steps provided in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tienmanh94hbk/capacitor-exit-app-ios) of the package.

### iOS Setup

1. Install CocoaPods:
   ```
   sudo gem install cocoapods
   ```
2. Create a new Capacitor project:
   ```
   ionic start my-cap-app --capacitor
   ```
3. Add iOS platform to your project:
   ```
   cd my-cap-app
   mkdir www && touch www/index.html
   npx cap add ios
   ```
4. Install `capacitor-exit-app-ios` package:
   ```
   npm i capacitor-exit-app-ios
   ```
5. Sync the iOS platform with Capacitor:
   ```
   npx cap sync ios
   ```
6. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```
   npx cap open ios
   ```
7. Sign your app in Xcode under the General tab.

## Usage

You can now use the `killApp()` method provided by the `capacitor-exit-app-ios` package to force quit the app on iOS. Here is an example of how to use it in your code:

```javascript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
const { ExitAppIosPlugin } = Plugins;

if (this.platform.is('android')) {
    navigator['app'].exitApp();
} else {
    ExitAppIosPlugin.killApp().then();
}
```

Remember that this plugin may not be allowed upon Apple review, as it's meant to force quit the app, which goes against usual app behavior.

## Example

```bash
npm start
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to integrate and use the `capacitor-exit-app-ios` package to force quit an iOS app using Capacitor. Make sure to handle the usage of this plugin carefully, as it may affect user experience and compliance with Apple's guidelines.
