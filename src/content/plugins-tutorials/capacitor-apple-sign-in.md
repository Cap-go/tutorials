## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of Capacitor and how to create a Capacitor app.
- Xcode (for iOS development) or Android Studio (for Android development) installed on your computer.
- A registered Apple Developer account, if you want to test the Sign In with Apple functionality on iOS.

## Installing the Package

To begin, let's install the `cap-apple-sign-in` package into our Capacitor app. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project's root directory. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install cap-apple-sign-in
```

## Configuring the App

Next, we need to configure the app to use the `cap-apple-sign-in` package. Follow these steps:

1. Open your project's `capacitor.config.json` file.
2. Add the following code snippet within the `plugins` section:

```json
{
  "name": "capacitor-apple-sign-in",
  "path": "node_modules/cap-apple-sign-in"
}
```

3. Save the `capacitor.config.json` file.

## Implementing Sign In with Apple

Now that we have installed and configured the `cap-apple-sign-in` package, we can proceed with implementing the sign-in functionality.

1. Open your desired component file where you want to implement the Sign In with Apple button.
2. Import the necessary modules:

```javascript
import { Plugins } from "@capacitor/core";
const { CapAppleSignIn } = Plugins;
```

3. Add the following code to handle the Sign In with Apple button click event:

```javascript

async function signInWithApple() {
  try {
    const { response } = await CapAppleSignIn.signIn();
    const { userIdentifier, email, givenName, familyName } = response;
    
    // Handle the response as per your app's requirements
    console.log("User Identifier:", userIdentifier);
    console.log("Email:", email);
    console.log("Given Name:", givenName);
    console.log("Family Name:", familyName);
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
    console.error(error);
  }
}

```

4. Finally, add the Sign In with Apple button in your component's template and bind the `signInWithApple` function to its click event:

```html
<button (click)="signInWithApple()">Sign In with Apple</button>
```

That's it! You have successfully implemented the Sign In with Apple functionality in your Capacitor app using the `cap-apple-sign-in` package.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we saw how to use the `cap-apple-sign-in` package in a Capacitor app to enable Sign In with Apple functionality. We covered the installation and configuration steps, as well as implementing the sign-in functionality. You can now use the `cap-apple-sign-in` package to provide a seamless sign-in experience to your users using their Apple IDs.
