# Using the capacitor-reader-plugin Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the capacitor-reader-plugin package in a Capacitor project. The capacitor-reader-plugin package allows you to read and process different types of files in your application using Capacitor.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following installed:

- Capacitor
- capacitor-reader-plugin package

If you haven't installed Capacitor yet, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @capacitor/cli
```

To install the capacitor-reader-plugin package, use the following command:

```bash
npm install capacitor-reader-plugin
```

## Usage

To use the capacitor-reader-plugin package in your Capacitor project, follow these steps:

### 1. Import the Plugin

First, import the capacitor-reader-plugin in your project's source file:

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
const { ReaderPlugin } = Plugins;
```

### 2. Read a File

To read a file using the capacitor-reader-plugin, call the `readFile()` method:

```typescript
async function readFileContent(filePath: string): Promise<string> {
  const result = await ReaderPlugin.readFile({ path: filePath });
  return result.content;
}
```

The `readFile()` method takes an object with a `path` property which specifies the file path to read.

### 3. Use the File Content

Once you have retrieved the file content, you can use it in your application as needed. For example, you can display the content in a text area:

```typescript
const fileContent = await readFileContent('/path/to/file.txt');
textareaElement.value = fileContent;
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the capacitor-reader-plugin package in a Capacitor project. We covered the steps to import the plugin, read a file, and use the file content in your application. Now you can easily read and process different types of files in your Capacitor project using the capacitor-reader-plugin package.
