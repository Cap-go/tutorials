# Using the health-data package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the health-data package to retrieve and manage health data in your app. The health-data package provides a simple and convenient way to access health data from various sources such as fitness trackers, smartwatches, and health apps.

## Installation

First, let's install the health-data package using npm:

```bash
npm install health-data
```

## Retrieve Health Data

Once the package is installed, we can start retrieving health data. Import the `HealthData` class from the health-data package:

```javascript
import { HealthData } from 'health-data';
```

Create an instance of the `HealthData` class:

```javascript
const healthData = new HealthData();
```

### Retrieve Step Count

To retrieve the step count data, use the `getStepCount` method:

```javascript
const stepCountData = await healthData.getStepCount();
console.log(stepCountData);
```

The `getStepCount` method returns an array of step count data objects. Each object contains information such as the date, number of steps, and source.

### Retrieve Heart Rate

To retrieve the heart rate data, use the `getHeartRate` method:

```javascript
const heartRateData = await healthData.getHeartRate();
console.log(heartRateData);
```

The `getHeartRate` method returns an array of heart rate data objects. Each object contains information such as the date, heart rate value, and source.

## Add New Health Data

The health-data package also allows you to add new health data entries. Use the `addDataEntry` method to add a new data entry:

```javascript
const newEntry = {
  date: new Date(),
  value: 5000,
  source: 'My App'
};

await healthData.addDataEntry(newEntry);
```

The `addDataEntry` method takes an object with properties such as `date`, `value`, and `source`. You can customize these properties based on your requirements.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have learned how to use the health-data package to retrieve and manage health data in your app. Now you can integrate health data from various sources and provide valuable insights to your users.

Remember to handle permissions and privacy concerns when accessing health data.

Feel free to explore the health-data package documentation for more advanced features and customization options.

Happy coding!
