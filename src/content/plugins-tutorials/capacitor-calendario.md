### Step 1: Install the capacitor-calendario Package

To get started, install the capacitor-calendario package in your Capacitor app. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install capacitor-calendario
```

### Step 2: Import and Initialize the Plugin

In your app's main file (`index.ts` or `app.module.ts`), import the `Calendar` plugin from the capacitor-calendario package and initialize it:

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { Calendar } = Plugins;

// Initialize the plugin
Calendar.initialize();
```

### Step 3: Request Calendar Permissions

To access the device's calendar, you need to request the necessary permissions from the user. Add the following code in the appropriate place (e.g., in a button click handler):

```typescript
async requestCalendarPermissions() {
  try {
    await Calendar.requestPermissions();
    console.log('Calendar permissions granted.');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to request calendar permissions:', error);
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Create a Calendar Event

To create a new event in the device's calendar, use the `createEvent` method:

```typescript
async createEvent() {
  try {
    const event = {
      title: 'My Event',
      location: 'San Francisco',
      startDate: new Date('2022-01-01T09:00:00Z'),
      endDate: new Date('2022-01-01T10:00:00Z'),
      description: 'This is my event description'
    };

    await Calendar.createEvent(event);
    console.log('Event created successfully.');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to create event:', error);
  }
}
```

Note: Make sure to adjust the values of the `title`, `location`, `startDate`, `endDate`, and `description` properties according to your needs.

### Step 5: Read Calendar Events

To fetch the events from the device's calendar, use the `getEvents` method:

```typescript
async getEvents() {
  try {
    const events = await Calendar.getEvents();
    console.log('Events:', events);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to get events:', error);
  }
}
```

This method will return an array of calendar events.

### Step 6: Delete a Calendar Event

To delete a specific event from the device's calendar, use the `deleteEvent` method:

```typescript
async deleteEvent(eventId: string) {
  try {
    await Calendar.deleteEvent({ eventId });
    console.log('Event deleted successfully.');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to delete event:', error);
  }
}
```

Make sure to pass the `eventId` of the event you wish to delete.

That's it! You have successfully learned how to use the capacitor-calendario package to work with calendars in your Capacitor app.

Remember to import the necessary dependencies and adjust the code according to your app's needs. Have fun developing!
