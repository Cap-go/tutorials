# Using capacitor-plugin-usb-printer package

In this tutorial, we will guide you on how to use the `capacitor-plugin-usb-printer` package to handle USB printers in your Capacitor project. This plugin allows you to connect and send print commands to USB printers directly from your mobile application.

## Installation

To install the `capacitor-plugin-usb-printer` package, follow these steps:

1. Install the plugin using npm or yarn:
```shell
npm install capacitor-plugin-usb-printer
```

2. Initialize the plugin in your Capacitor project:
```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
const { UsbPrinter } = Plugins;

// Make sure to call this before using any other methods from the UsbPrinter plugin
UsbPrinter.initialize();
```

## Connecting to a USB Printer

To connect to a USB printer, use the `connect()` method provided by the `UsbPrinter` plugin. This method allows you to search for available USB printers and establish a connection with the chosen printer.

```typescript
// Search for available printers and connect to the chosen printer
const connectToPrinter = async (): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    const printers = await UsbPrinter.getPrinters();
    // Choose a printer from the list
    const selectedPrinter = printers[0];
    await UsbPrinter.connect(selectedPrinter);
    console.log("Connected to printer:", selectedPrinter);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to connect to printer:", error);
  }
};

// Call the connectToPrinter() function to connect to a printer
connectToPrinter();
```

## Sending Print Commands

Once you have successfully connected to a USB printer, you can use the `printText()` method to send print commands to the printer. This method takes a string as a parameter and sends it to the printer for printing.

```typescript
// Send a text string to the connected printer for printing
const printTextString = async (text: string): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    await UsbPrinter.printText(text);
    console.log("Text printed successfully:", text);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to print text:", error);
  }
};

// Call the printTextString() function to print a text string
printTextString("Hello, World!");
```

## Disconnecting from the Printer

To disconnect from the connected printer, use the `disconnect()` method provided by the `UsbPrinter` plugin. This method closes the connection to the printer.

```typescript
// Disconnect from the connected printer
const disconnectFromPrinter = async (): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    await UsbPrinter.disconnect();
    console.log("Disconnected from printer");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to disconnect from printer:", error);
  }
};

// Call the disconnectFromPrinter() function to disconnect from the printer
disconnectFromPrinter();
```

That's it! You have successfully learned how to use the `capacitor-plugin-usb-printer` package to handle USB printers in your Capacitor project. Feel free to explore the plugin's documentation for more advanced features and options.
