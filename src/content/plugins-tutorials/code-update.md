# Using the capacitor-code-update Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `capacitor-code-update` package to update code in Capacitor projects.

## Step 1: Install the Package

First, you need to install the `capacitor-code-update` package. You can do this by running the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install capacitor-code-update
```

## Step 2: Make the Necessary Commits

Before updating your code, it's important to make sure all your changes are committed. This ensures that you have a clean working state to start from.

## Step 3: Update the Code

To update your code using the `capacitor-code-update` package, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command to update the code:
```bash
npx capacitor-code-update
```
This command will prompt you to select the version of the code you want to update to (based on the supported versions mentioned in the package documentation).

2. Select the appropriate version based on your requirements. For example, if you are using Capacitor 2, choose version 0.0.8. If you are using Capacitor 3, choose version 0.0.10. If you are using Capacitor 5, choose version 5.0.0.

## Step 5: Publish the Update

Once you have tested and verified the code update, you can proceed to publish it. Follow these steps:

1. Run the following command to increment the version number in your `package.json` file:
```bash
npm version patch
```
This command will automatically increment the patch version of your package, indicating that a code update has been made.

2. Finally, run the following command to publish the updated code to your package registry:
