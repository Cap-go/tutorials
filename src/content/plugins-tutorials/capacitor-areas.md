# Using Capacitor-Areas Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the Capacitor-Areas package in your Capacitor projects. Capacitor-Areas is a Capacitor community plugin that allows you to easily work with geofencing and beacons within your mobile applications.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the Capacitor-Areas package into your project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install capacitor-areas
```

Once the installation is complete, you can proceed to the next step.

## Usage

To use Capacitor-Areas in your project, follow these steps:

1. Import the `CapacitorAreas` object from the `capacitor-areas` package in your JavaScript or TypeScript file:

```javascript
import { CapacitorAreas } from 'capacitor-areas';
```

2. Initialize Capacitor-Areas by calling the `initialize()` method. This method initializes the plugin and sets up the necessary configurations:

```javascript
CapacitorAreas.initialize();
```

3. Use the various methods provided by Capacitor-Areas to work with geofencing and beacons in your application.

For example, you can use the `registerGeofence` method to register a geofence:

```javascript
const geofence = {
  id: '1',
  latitude: 37.7749,
  longitude: -122.4194,
  radius: 100,
  transitionType: 'ENTER',
  notification: {
    title: 'Welcome',
    body: 'You have entered the geofence area'
  }
};

CapacitorAreas.registerGeofence(geofence);
```

4. You can also use the various event listeners provided by Capacitor-Areas to listen for geofence and beacon events:

```javascript
CapacitorAreas.addListener('geofenceEnter', (data) => {
  console.log('Geofence entered:', data);
});

CapacitorAreas.addListener('beaconRegionEnter', (data) => {
  console.log('Beacon region entered:', data);
});
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to install and use the Capacitor-Areas package in your Capacitor projects. This package provides a convenient way to work with geofencing and beacons within your mobile applications. You can now incorporate geofencing and beacon functionality into your apps more easily using Capacitor-Areas.
