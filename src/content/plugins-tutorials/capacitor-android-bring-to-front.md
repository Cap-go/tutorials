# Using the capacitor-android-bring-to-front Package

In this tutorial, we will explore the capacitor-android-bring-to-front package and learn how to use it to bring an Android app to the front of the screen. This package is useful in scenarios where you want to programmatically bring your app to the foreground, ensuring that it becomes visible to the user.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this tutorial, make sure you have the following:

- An existing Ionic app using Capacitor.
- Basic knowledge of Capacitor and Android development.
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your development machine.

## Installation

To get started, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Ionic project.

1. Install the capacitor-android-bring-to-front package using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install capacitor-android-bring-to-front
   ```

2. Add the Android platform to your Capacitor project:

   ```bash
   ionic capacitor add android
   ```

## Usage

The capacitor-android-bring-to-front package provides a simple API to bring the Android app to the front. Let's see how to use it in your Ionic app.

1. Import the package in your Ionic app's main code file (e.g., app.component.ts):

   ```typescript
   import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
   const { CapacitorAndroidBringToFront } = Plugins;
   ```

2. Add a button or trigger in your app's UI to call the `bringToFront()` method:

   ```typescript
   async bringAppToFront() {
     try {
       await CapacitorAndroidBringToFront.bringToFront();
       console.log('App brought to the front successfully!');
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Failed to bring the app to the front:', error);
     }
   }
   ```

3. Attach the `bringAppToFront()` method to an event trigger, such as a button click:

   ```html
   <ion-button (click)="bringAppToFront()">Bring App to Front</ion-button>
   ```

4. Run your Ionic app on an Android device or emulator:

   ```bash
   ionic capacitor run android -l --external
   ```

   This command will start your Ionic app and open it on the connected Android device or emulator.

5. Click the "Bring App to Front" button in your app to call the `bringToFront()` method.

   You should see your app being brought to the front and becoming visible on the screen.
