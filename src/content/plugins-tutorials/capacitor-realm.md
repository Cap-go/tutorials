## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `capacitor-realm` package to integrate Realm database in a Capacitor app. We will cover the installation steps and demonstrate how to perform basic database operations using `capacitor-realm`.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- Capacitor CLI
- Realm Database

## Step 1: Install the `capacitor-realm` package

To get started, open your terminal and navigate to your Capacitor project's root directory. Then, run the following command to install the `capacitor-realm` package:

```bash
npm install capacitor-realm
```

## Step 2: Configure `capacitor-realm` in your project

Next, open your Capacitor project's main `index.js` file and import the `capacitor-realm` plugin. Add the following code snippet to configure the plugin:

```javascript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
import 'capacitor-realm';

const { CapacitorRealm } = Plugins;

CapacitorRealm.initialize();
```

## Step 3: Create a realm instance

To create a new Realm database instance, use the `CapacitorRealm.open()` method. This method returns a promise that resolves to the Realm instance. Here's how you can create a new instance:

```javascript
const realmInstance = await CapacitorRealm.open('myRealm');
```

Make sure to replace `'myRealm'` with your desired Realm database name.

## Step 4: Perform database operations

Now that you have a Realm instance, you can perform various database operations such as creating objects, querying data, and updating records. Here are a few examples to get you started:

### 4.1. Creating an object

To create a new object in your Realm database, use the `createObject()` method. Here's an example:

```javascript
realmInstance.write(() => {
  const person = realmInstance.createObject('Person', {
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 25,
  });
});
```

### 4.2. Querying data

To query data from your Realm database, use the `objects()` method. Here's an example:

```javascript
const people = realmInstance.objects('Person');
console.log(people);
```

### 4.3. Updating records

To update records in your Realm database, use the `write()` method. Here's an example:

```javascript
realmInstance.write(() => {
  const person = realmInstance.objects('Person')[0];
  person.name = 'Jane Smith';
});
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to install and use the `capacitor-realm` package to integrate Realm database in a Capacitor app. We covered the installation steps, configuring the plugin, creating a Realm instance, and performing basic database operations. With the knowledge gained from this tutorial, you can now build powerful offline-first apps using Realm database with Capacitor.
