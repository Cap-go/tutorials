# Using the bulk-contact package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the bulk-contact package to manage contacts in your application.

## Installation

First, you need to install the bulk-contact package using the following command:

```bash
npm install bulk-contact
```

## Importing the package

To use the bulk-contact package in your code, you need to import it as shown below:

```javascript
import { BulkContact } from 'bulk-contact';
```

## Initializing the BulkContact object

Next, you need to initialize the BulkContact object with the required configuration. Here is an example:

```javascript
const bulkContact = new BulkContact({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
});
```

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key and `'https://api.example.com'` with the URL of your API endpoint.

## Fetching contacts

To fetch contacts from the API, you can use the `getContacts` method of the BulkContact object. This method returns a promise that resolves to an array of contacts. Here is an example:

```javascript
bulkContact.getContacts()
  .then(contacts => {
    console.log(contacts);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

## Adding a new contact

To add a new contact, you can use the `addContact` method of the BulkContact object. This method takes an object representing the contact details as the parameter. Here is an example:

```javascript
const newContact = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'johndoe@example.com',
  phone: '+1 123-456-7890',
};

bulkContact.addContact(newContact)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Contact added successfully');
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

## Updating a contact

To update an existing contact, you can use the `updateContact` method of the BulkContact object. This method takes the contact ID and an object representing the updated contact details as parameters. Here is an example:

```javascript
const contactId = 'CONTACT_ID';
const updatedContact = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'johndoe@example.com',
  phone: '+1 123-456-7890',
};

bulkContact.updateContact(contactId, updatedContact)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Contact updated successfully');
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

Make sure to replace `'CONTACT_ID'` with the actual ID of the contact you want to update.

## Deleting a contact

To delete a contact, you can use the `deleteContact` method of the BulkContact object. This method takes the contact ID as the parameter. Here is an example:

```javascript
const contactId = 'CONTACT_ID';

bulkContact.deleteContact(contactId)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Contact deleted successfully');
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

Make sure to replace `'CONTACT_ID'` with the actual ID of the contact you want to delete.

That's it! You have learned how to use the bulk-contact package to manage contacts in your application. Feel free to explore more features and functionalities provided by the package in the official documentation.

Remember to handle errors and provide appropriate error handling in your code to ensure a robust and reliable contact management system.

Happy coding!
