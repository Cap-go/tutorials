# Capacitor Plugin Headset Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `capacitor-plugin-headset` package to interact with the device's headset functionality in a Capacitor project.

## Installation

To begin, make sure you have Capacitor installed globally. If not, run the following command:

```shell
npm install -g @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
```

Next, add the `capacitor-plugin-headset` package to your project.

```shell
npm install capacitor-plugin-headset
```

## Configuration

### Android Configuration

No additional configuration is required for Android.

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, open your `Podfile` located in the `ios` directory and add the following line:

```ruby
pod 'CapacitorHeadset', :path => '../node_modules/capacitor-plugin-headset'
```

Save the file and run the following command inside the `ios` directory to install the plugin:

```shell
pod install
```

## Usage

Import the plugin in your JavaScript file:

```javascript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
const { Headset } = Plugins;
```

### Checking Headset Connection

To check if a headset is connected to the device, use the `isConnected` method:

```javascript
const isConnected = await Headset.isConnected();
console.log(`Headset is connected: ${isConnected.value}`);
```

The `isConnected` method returns a boolean value indicating the connection status of the headset.

### Listening for Headset Connection Changes

To listen for changes in the headset connection status, use the `addListener` method:

```javascript
Headset.addListener('headsetStateChanged', (state) => {
  console.log(`Headset state changed: ${state.isConnected}`);
});
```

The `addListener` method takes an event name and a callback function. The callback function is executed whenever the headset connection state changes.

### Controlling Headset Playback

To control headset playback, use the `play`, `pause`, and `stop` methods:

```javascript
await Headset.play();
await Headset.pause();
await Headset.stop();
```

These methods allow you to play, pause, and stop media playback through the connected headset.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to install and use the `capacitor-plugin-headset` package in a Capacitor project. We covered checking the headset connection status, listening for headset connection changes, and controlling headset playback. With this knowledge, you can easily integrate headset functionality into your Capacitor application.
