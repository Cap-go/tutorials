# Using @rdlabo/capacitor-screenshot-event package

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `@rdlabo/capacitor-screenshot-event` package in a Capacitor app. This package allows you to detect when a screenshot is taken on the device. We will cover the installation, usage, and example code.

## Installation

Before we can start using the `@rdlabo/capacitor-screenshot-event` package, we need to install it in our Capacitor app. Follow these steps to install the package:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your Capacitor app directory.
3. Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
npm install @rdlabo/capacitor-screenshot-event
```

## Usage

Once the package is installed, we can start using it in our app. Here are the steps to use the `@rdlabo/capacitor-screenshot-event` package:

1. Import the package in your TypeScript file:

```typescript
import { Plugins } from "@capacitor/core";
const { RDLaboCapacitorScreenshotEvent } = Plugins;
```

2. Initialize the `@rdlabo/capacitor-screenshot-event` plugin in your app:

```typescript
RDLaboCapacitorScreenshotEvent.initialize();
```

3. Register an event listener to detect when a screenshot is taken:

```typescript
RDLaboCapacitorScreenshotEvent.addListener("screenshotTaken", () => {
  console.log("Screenshot taken!");
  // Do something when a screenshot is taken
});
```

4. Cleanup the event listener when no longer needed:

```typescript
const listener = RDLaboCapacitorScreenshotEvent.addListener("screenshotTaken", () => {
  // Handle screenshot event
});

// Remove the listener when no longer needed
listener.remove();
```

## Example

Here is a complete example of using the `@rdlabo/capacitor-screenshot-event` package:

```typescript
import { Plugins } from "@capacitor/core";
const { RDLaboCapacitorScreenshotEvent } = Plugins;

RDLaboCapacitorScreenshotEvent.initialize();

const listener = RDLaboCapacitorScreenshotEvent.addListener("screenshotTaken", () => {
  console.log("Screenshot taken!");
  // Do something when a screenshot is taken
});

// Cleanup the event listener when no longer needed
// listener.remove();
```
