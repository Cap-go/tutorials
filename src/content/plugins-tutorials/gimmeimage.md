# Using @swarmtechnology/gimmeimage Package

In this tutorial, we will explore the @swarmtechnology/gimmeimage package, which allows us to generate images programmatically.

## Installation

To get started, let's install the package using npm:

```bash
npm install @swarmtechnology/gimmeimage
```

## Usage

After the installation is complete, we can import the package and start using it in our code. Here is a basic example:

```javascript
const gimmeimage = require('@swarmtechnology/gimmeimage');

// Generate a random image URL
const imageUrl = gimmeimage();

console.log(imageUrl); // Output: https://example.com/random-image.jpg
```

The `gimmeimage` function provided by the package generates a random image URL every time it is called. This can be useful when we need to generate placeholder images or fetch random images in our applications.

We can also specify additional parameters to customize the generated images. For example:

```javascript
const imageUrl = gimmeimage({
  width: 500,
  height: 300,
  category: 'nature',
});

console.log(imageUrl); // Output: https://example.com/random-image.jpg?width=500&height=300&category=nature
```

In the above example, we set the desired width, height, and category for the image. The generated URL will include these parameters, allowing us to fetch images that meet our specific requirements.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to use the @swarmtechnology/gimmeimage package to generate images programmatically. By leveraging this package, we can easily generate random images or fetch images with custom parameters. This can be particularly useful in applications that require placeholder images, dynamic content, or image manipulation.
