# Using capacitor-plugin-coreml

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the capacitor-plugin-coreml package to integrate Core ML functionality into your Capacitor app. Core ML is a machine learning framework provided by Apple that allows developers to easily integrate machine learning models into their iOS apps. By using the capacitor-plugin-coreml package, you can leverage Core ML capabilities in your Capacitor app and perform tasks such as image recognition, text analysis, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- Capacitor installed globally (`npm install -g @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli`)

## Step 1: Create a new Capacitor project

First, let's create a new Capacitor project to work with. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx cap init [APP_NAME] [APP_ID]
```

Replace `[APP_NAME]` with the desired name of your app and `[APP_ID]` with the desired identifier for your app. This will create a new directory with the specified app name and initialize a new Capacitor project.

## Step 2: Install the capacitor-plugin-coreml package

Next, let's install the capacitor-plugin-coreml package. In your project directory, run the following command:

```bash
npm install capacitor-plugin-coreml
```

This will install the capacitor-plugin-coreml package and add it to your project's dependencies.

## Step 3: Link the plugin to your project

To link the capacitor-plugin-coreml plugin to your project, run the following command:

```bash
npx cap plugin add capacitor-plugin-coreml
```

This will add the plugin to your project's capacitor.config.json file.

## Step 4: Add a Core ML model to your project

To use Core ML functionality, you need to have a Core ML model file. If you already have a Core ML model, you can skip this step. Otherwise, you can find pre-trained Core ML models on websites like [Apple's Core ML Gallery](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/models/). Download a Core ML model file (.mlmodel) and add it to your project's assets folder.

## Step 5: Load and use the Core ML model in your code

Now that you have the capacitor-plugin-coreml package installed and a Core ML model file added to your project, you can load and use the Core ML model in your code. Open your project's main JS file (index.js or app.js) and import the capacitor-plugin-coreml package:

```javascript
import '@capacitor-community/coreml';
```

Next, you can use the `loadModel` function to load the Core ML model:

```javascript
const modelPath = 'path/to/your/model.mlmodel';
const model = await Capacitor.Plugins.CoreML.loadModel({ modelPath });
```

Once the model is loaded, you can use the various functions provided by the Core ML plugin to perform predictions or analysis using the loaded model.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the capacitor-plugin-coreml package to integrate Core ML functionality into your Capacitor app. We covered the installation of the package, linking the plugin to your project, adding a Core ML model, and using the plugin to load and use the Core ML model in your code. With the capacitor-plugin-coreml package, you can easily leverage the power of Core ML in your Capacitor app and create intelligent and personalized experiences for your users.

Remember to refer to the official documentation of capacitor-plugin-coreml for more detailed information and additional features.

Happy coding!
