# Using the migrate-cordova-localstorage Package

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the migrate-cordova-localstorage package to migrate data from Cordova local storage to a new storage solution. The package provides a simple and convenient way to transfer data stored in the browser's local storage to a different storage mechanism.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Cordova project set up and configured.
2. Node.js and NPM installed on your development machine.
3. Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Cordova development.

## Step 1: Installation

Start by installing the migrate-cordova-localstorage package in your Cordova project. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root folder of your project. Run the following command:

```shell
npm install migrate-cordova-localstorage
```

This will install the package and its dependencies in your project.

## Step 2: Usage

Once the package is installed, you can start using it to migrate the data from Cordova local storage. Here's an example of how to use the package in your code:

```javascript
import migrateCordovaLocalStorage from "migrate-cordova-localstorage";

// Specify the target storage mechanism
const targetStorage = "indexeddb";

// Migrate the data
migrateCordovaLocalStorage(targetStorage)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Data migration successful!");
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Data migration failed:", error);
  });
```

In the above code, we import the `migrateCordovaLocalStorage` function from the `migrate-cordova-localstorage` package. We then specify the target storage mechanism (e.g., "indexeddb") where we want to migrate the data. Finally, we call the `migrateCordovaLocalStorage` function and handle the promise's success and error callbacks.

## Step 3: Testing

After implementing the code for data migration, it's important to test the functionality to ensure everything is working as expected. Run your Cordova project with the changes and verify that the data is successfully migrated to the target storage mechanism.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the migrate-cordova-localstorage package to migrate data from Cordova local storage to a new storage solution. The package provides a simple and efficient way to transfer data, ensuring a smooth transition from the old storage mechanism to the new one.

By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you should now be able to incorporate the migrate-cordova-localstorage package into your Cordova project and migrate data with ease.

Happy coding!
