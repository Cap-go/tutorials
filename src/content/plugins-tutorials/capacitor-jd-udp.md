# Using capacitor-jd-udp package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to integrate the capacitor-jd-udp package into your Capacitor app to enable UDP communication. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a lightweight, connectionless protocol that allows fast communication over IP networks.

## Installation

To install the capacitor-jd-udp package, run the following command in your project root directory:

```bash
npm install capacitor-jd-udp
```

## Configuration

1. After installing the package, navigate to your project's `capacitor.config.json` file located in the root directory.

2. Add the following code snippet to the `plugins` section of the `capacitor.config.json` file:

```json
"plugins": {
  "CapacitorJDUDP": {}
}
```

3. Save the `capacitor.config.json` file.

## Usage

To use the capacitor-jd-udp package in your Capacitor app, follow these steps:

1. Import the `CapacitorJDUDP` module into your TypeScript file:

```typescript
import { CapacitorJDUDP } from 'capacitor-jd-udp';
```

2. Initialize the `CapacitorJDUDP` instance:

```typescript
const jdUdp = CapacitorJDUDP.initialize();
```

3. Use the various methods provided by the `CapacitorJDUDP` instance to send and receive UDP packets.

For example, to send a UDP packet:

```typescript
await jdUdp.send({ 
  ip: '192.168.0.1',
  port: 5000,
  message: 'Hello, UDP!'
});
```

4. To receive UDP packets, register a listener using the `addDataListener` method:

```typescript
jdUdp.addDataListener((data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

In the above example, `data` will contain the received packet.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated the capacitor-jd-udp package into your Capacitor app and learned how to send and receive UDP packets. You can now leverage the power of UDP communication in your app.

Remember to refer to the package documentation for more details and explore additional features that it offers.

Happy coding!
