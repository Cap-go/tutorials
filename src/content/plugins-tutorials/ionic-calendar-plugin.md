# Using the ionic-calendar-plugin Package

The `ionic-calendar-plugin` package allows you to perform various actions on the user's calendar in an Ionic application. With this package, you can create, update, find, and delete calendar events.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the `ionic-calendar-plugin` package by running the following command in your Ionic project:

```bash
npm install ionic-calendar-plugin
```

## Usage

### Importing the Plugin

To use the `ionic-calendar-plugin` package in your Ionic project, you need to import it in your TypeScript/JavaScript file:

```typescript
import { Capacitor } from '@capacitor/core';
import { CalendarPlugin } from 'ionic-calendar-plugin';
```

### Check Platform Compatibility

Before performing any actions on the calendar, it's recommended to check if the platform is compatible with the plugin. You can use the `Capacitor.isNativePlatform()` method to do this:

```typescript
const isNativePlatform = Capacitor.isNativePlatform();
if (!isNativePlatform) {
  console.log('The ionic-calendar-plugin is only supported on native platforms.');
  return;
}
```

### Create a Calendar Event

To create a new calendar event, you can use the `createEvent()` method of the `CalendarPlugin`. This method takes in an object with the event details such as title, location, start date, and end date. Here's an example:

```typescript
try {
  await CalendarPlugin.createEvent({
    title: 'Meeting',
    location: 'Office',
    startDate: new Date(),
    endDate: new Date(Date.now() + 3600000), // 1 hour from now
  });
  console.log('Calendar event created successfully.');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error creating calendar event:', error);
}
```

### Find a Calendar Event

To find a calendar event based on specific criteria, you can use the `findEvent()` method of the `CalendarPlugin`. This method takes in an object with the event details you want to search for. Here's an example:

```typescript
try {
  const event = await CalendarPlugin.findEvent({
    title: 'Meeting',
    location: 'Office',
  });
  console.log('Found event:', event);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error finding calendar event:', error);
}
```

### Update a Calendar Event

To update an existing calendar event, you can use the `updateEvent()` method of the `CalendarPlugin`. This method takes in an object with the updated event details and the event ID. Here's an example:

```typescript
try {
  await CalendarPlugin.updateEvent({
    eventId: '123',
    title: 'Updated Meeting',
    location: 'New Office',
    startDate: new Date(),
    endDate: new Date(Date.now() + 3600000), // 1 hour from now
  });
  console.log('Calendar event updated successfully.');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error updating calendar event:', error);
}
```

### Delete a Calendar Event

To delete a calendar event, you can use the `deleteEventById()` method of the `CalendarPlugin`. This method takes in the ID of the event you want to delete. Here's an example:

```typescript
try {
  await CalendarPlugin.deleteEventById({ id: '123' });
  console.log('Calendar event deleted successfully.');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error deleting calendar event:', error);
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to use the `ionic-calendar-plugin` package to interact with the user's calendar in Ionic applications. We learned how to create, find, update, and delete calendar events using the plugin. With this knowledge, you can now integrate calendar functionality into your Ionic projects with ease. Happy coding!
