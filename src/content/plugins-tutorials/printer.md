# Using the Moz POS Printer Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the Moz POS Printer package to print receipts and other documents from your Android app.

## Step 1: Install the Package

To begin, install the Moz POS Printer package by running the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install printer
npx cap sync
```

This will install the required dependencies and sync the Capacitor project.

## Step 2: Import and Initialize the Printer

In your app's code, import the `print` function from the Moz POS Printer package. You can do this by adding the following line at the beginning of your file:

```javascript
import { print } from 'printer';
```

Next, initialize the printer by calling the `print` function with the appropriate options. For example:

```javascript
const options = {
  // Add relevant printer options here
};

print(options)
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.message);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

Replace `// Add relevant printer options here` with the desired printer settings, such as the document content, formatting, and other properties.

## Step 3: Handle the Print Response

The `print` function returns a promise that resolves to a `SuccessResponse` object upon successful printing. You can access the response message using `response.message`, as shown in the example above.

In case of an error during printing, the promise will be rejected and you can handle the error using the `catch` method.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the Moz POS Printer package to print receipts and other documents from an Android app. We covered the installation process, initialization of the printer, handling the print response, and error handling.

Now, you can integrate the Moz POS Printer package into your Android app to enable seamless printing functionality. Happy coding!
