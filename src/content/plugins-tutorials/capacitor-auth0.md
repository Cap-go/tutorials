# Using @taretmch/capacitor-auth0 Package

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of integrating the **@taretmch/capacitor-auth0** package into your Capacitor app. The **@taretmch/capacitor-auth0** package allows you to easily implement authentication using Auth0 in your Capacitor app.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- Capacitor project set up.
- An Auth0 account.
- Basic knowledge of Capacitor and Auth0 concepts.

## Step 1: Install the Package

Start by installing the **@taretmch/capacitor-auth0** package into your Capacitor project. Open your project directory in the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install @taretmch/capacitor-auth0
```

## Step 2: Configure Auth0

Next, you need to configure your Auth0 account and obtain the necessary credentials. Log in to your Auth0 account dashboard and navigate to the "Applications" section:

1. Create a new application for your Capacitor project.
2. Note down the *Client ID* and *Domain* values, as we will need them later.

## Step 3: Initialize the Plugin

Now, let's initialize the **@taretmch/capacitor-auth0** plugin in your Capacitor app:

1. Open the `capacitor.config.json` file in your project's root directory.
2. Add the following configuration under the `plugins` section:

```json
"Auth0": {
  "clientId": "YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID",
  "domain": "YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN"
}
```

Replace `YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN` with the actual values from your Auth0 application.

## Step 4: Implement Authentication Flow

You can now implement the authentication flow using the **@taretmch/capacitor-auth0** package in your app. Here's a basic example:

1. Import the plugin in your code:

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
const { Auth0 } = Plugins;
```

2. Implement the login method:

```typescript
async function login() {
  try {
    const result = await Auth0.login();
    console.log(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

3. Implement the logout method:

```typescript
async function logout() {
  try {
    const result = await Auth0.logout();
    console.log(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Test the Authentication Flow

You can now test the authentication flow in your Capacitor app. Make sure you have the necessary UI components and buttons to trigger the login and logout methods.

When you trigger the login method, the user will be redirected to the Auth0 login page. After successful authentication, the plugin will return an access token or ID token, which you can use for further API calls.

When you trigger the logout method, the user will be logged out of your app.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to integrate the **@taretmch/capacitor-auth0** package into your Capacitor app and implement the authentication flow using Auth0. You can now provide a secure and seamless authentication experience for your users.
