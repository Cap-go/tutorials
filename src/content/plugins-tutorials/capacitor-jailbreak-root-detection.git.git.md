I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information on using the `@aalzehla/capacitor-jailbreak-root-detection` package to generate a markdown tutorial. For detailed instructions and guidance on using this package, I recommend referring to the official documentation or the repository where it is hosted.

If you have any other questions or need general assistance, feel free to ask!
