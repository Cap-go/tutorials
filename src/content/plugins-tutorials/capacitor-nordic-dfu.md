# Using capacitor-nordic-dfu: A Step-by-Step Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of using the capacitor-nordic-dfu package to perform firmware updates on Nordic devices using Capacitor. The capacitor-nordic-dfu package provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the Nordic Device Firmware Update (DFU) process. 

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A Nordic device with firmware that supports DFU
- Capacitor installed in your project
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine

## Step 1: Install the capacitor-nordic-dfu package

To get started, open your terminal and navigate to your Capacitor project directory. Run the following command to install the capacitor-nordic-dfu package:

```bash
npm install capacitor-nordic-dfu
```

This will install the package and add it to your project's dependencies.

## Step 2: Import the capacitor-nordic-dfu package

Once the package is installed, you need to import it in your code. Open the file where you want to use the capacitor-nordic-dfu package and add the following line at the top:

```typescript
import { CapacitorNordicDfu } from 'capacitor-nordic-dfu';
```

## Step 3: Initialize the capacitor-nordic-dfu plugin

Next, you need to initialize the capacitor-nordic-dfu plugin. This is typically done in the `ngOnInit` or `ionViewWillEnter` lifecycle hook of your component. Add the following code in your component:

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
  CapacitorNordicDfu.initialize();
}
```

## Step 4: Perform a firmware update

Now that the capacitor-nordic-dfu plugin is initialized, you can perform a firmware update on your Nordic device. Add the following code in your component:

```typescript
async performFirmwareUpdate() {
  try {
    const result = await CapacitorNordicDfu.performFirmwareUpdate('path/to/firmware/file');
    console.log('Firmware update successful:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Firmware update failed:', error);
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace `'path/to/firmware/file'` with the actual path to your firmware file.

## Step 5: Handle firmware update progress and events

During the firmware update process, you can handle progress and events using the capacitor-nordic-dfu plugin. Add the following code in your component:

```typescript
CapacitorNordicDfu.addListener('progress', (data) => {
  const { progress, currentPart, totalParts } = data;
  console.log('Firmware update progress:', progress);
  console.log('Current part:', currentPart);
  console.log('Total parts:', totalParts);
});

CapacitorNordicDfu.addListener('disconnect', () => {
  console.log('Device disconnected during firmware update');
});

CapacitorNordicDfu.addListener('complete', () => {
  console.log('Firmware update complete');
});
```

These event listeners allow you to track the progress of the firmware update, handle disconnects during the update process, and get notified when the update is complete.

## Step 6: Clean up resources

After the firmware update is complete or if it fails, make sure to clean up any resources used by the capacitor-nordic-dfu plugin. Add the following code in your component:

```typescript
async ngOnDestroy() {
  await CapacitorNordicDfu.cleanup();
}
```

This will ensure that any resources used by the plugin are properly released.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to use the capacitor-nordic-dfu package to perform firmware updates on Nordic devices using Capacitor. We covered the installation process, initializing the plugin, performing a firmware update, handling progress and events, and cleaning up resources.

Now you can integrate the capacitor-nordic-dfu package into your Capacitor project and easily perform firmware updates on your Nordic devices. Happy coding!
