# Tutorial: Using zeus-capacitor-push-notifications package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the zeus-capacitor-push-notifications package to implement push notifications in your Capacitor project.

## Step 1: Installation

To start using zeus-capacitor-push-notifications, you need to first install it in your project. You can do this by running the following command:

```
npm install zeus-capacitor-push-notifications
```

## Step 2: Configuration

After installing the package, we need to configure it. Open your Capacitor project and locate the `capacitor.config.json` file. Add the following lines to the plugins section:

```json
"plugins": {
    "ZeusCapacitorPushNotifications": {
        "someConfig": "value"
    }
}
```

Replace `"someConfig"` with the appropriate configuration options for your project.

## Step 3: Registering a Device for Push Notifications

Now, we need to register the device to receive push notifications. Add the following code to your project:

```typescript
import { ZeusCapacitorPushNotifications } from 'zeus-capacitor-push-notifications';

ZeusCapacitorPushNotifications.register().then(() => {
    console.log('Device registered for push notifications');
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Failed to register device for push notifications:', error);
});
```

## Step 4: Handling Incoming Push Notifications

To handle incoming push notifications, add the following code to your project:

```typescript
import { ZeusCapacitorPushNotifications } from 'zeus-capacitor-push-notifications';

ZeusCapacitorPushNotifications.addListener('pushNotificationReceived', (notification) => {
    console.log('Received push notification:', notification);
});

ZeusCapacitorPushNotifications.addListener('pushNotificationClicked', (notification) => {
    console.log('Clicked push notification:', notification);
});
```

You can now customize the handling of push notifications based on your requirements.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to use the zeus-capacitor-push-notifications package to implement push notifications in your Capacitor project. We covered the installation, configuration, device registration, and handling of incoming push notifications. Now you can take this knowledge and integrate push notifications into your own apps successfully.
