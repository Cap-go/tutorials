# Using the capacitor-greatday-camera-location package

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the capacitor-greatday-camera-location package to integrate camera and location functionalities into your Capacitor project.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following:

1. Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. Capacitor set up in your project.
3. Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Capacitor.

## Step 1: Installation

To begin, let's install the `capacitor-greatday-camera-location` package. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install capacitor-greatday-camera-location
```

This will install the package and add it as a dependency in your project's `package.json` file.

## Step 2: Configuration

Once the package is installed, we need to configure it for use in our project. Open your `capacitor.config.json` file and add the following entry under the `plugins` section:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "GreatdayCameraLocation": {
      "YOUR_API_KEY": "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with your actual Google Maps API key. This key is required for the location functionality provided by the package.

## Step 3: Using the Camera

Now that the package is installed and configured, we can start using the camera feature. Import the necessary functions from the package in your JavaScript file:

```javascript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { GreatdayCameraLocation } = Plugins;
```

### Taking a Photo

To take a photo using the camera, use the `GreatdayCameraLocation.takePhoto()` function. This function returns a promise that resolves to the captured photo's file path:

```javascript
async function takePhoto() {
  try {
    const result = await GreatdayCameraLocation.takePhoto();
    const photoPath = result.filePath;
    console.log('Photo captured:', photoPath);
  } catch(error) {
    console.error('Failed to capture photo:', error);
  }
}
```

### Accessing the Photo Gallery

To access the photo gallery and select a photo, use the `GreatdayCameraLocation.getPhotos()` function. This function returns a promise that resolves to an array of selected photo file paths:

```javascript
async function selectPhotoFromGallery() {
  try {
    const result = await GreatdayCameraLocation.getPhotos();
    const photoPaths = result.filePaths;
    console.log('Selected photos:', photoPaths);
  } catch(error) {
    console.error('Failed to select photos:', error);
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Location

The capacitor-greatday-camera-location package also provides location functionality. Import the necessary functions from the package in your JavaScript file:

```javascript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { GreatdayCameraLocation } = Plugins;
```

### Getting the Current Location

To retrieve the device's current location, use the `GreatdayCameraLocation.getCurrentLocation()` function. This function returns a promise that resolves to the device's latitude and longitude:

```javascript
async function getCurrentLocation() {
  try {
    const result = await GreatdayCameraLocation.getCurrentLocation();
    const latitude = result.latitude;
    const longitude = result.longitude;
    console.log('Current location:', latitude, longitude);
  } catch(error) {
    console.error('Failed to get current location:', error);
  }
}
```

### Opening Google Maps

To open Google Maps and display a specific location using its latitude and longitude, use the `GreatdayCameraLocation.openMap()` function. Pass the latitude and longitude as parameters:

```javascript
async function openGoogleMaps() {
  try {
    const latitude = 37.7749;
    const longitude = -122.4194;
    await GreatdayCameraLocation.openMap(latitude, longitude);
  } catch(error) {
    console.error('Failed to open Google Maps:', error);
  }
}
```

## Conclusion
