# Using @nadlowebagentur/audio-control Package

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `@nadlowebagentur/audio-control` package to control audio playback and manage playlists in a Capacitor project. This package provides native support for audio playlists, background audio playback, and lock screen controls.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- A Capacitor project set up and configured. If you don't have one, follow the official Capacitor documentation to get started.

- Node.js and npm installed on your development machine.

## Installation

To install the `@nadlowebagentur/audio-control` package, run the following command:

```console
npm install @nadlowebagentur/audio-control
```

## Usage

### 1. Import the package

Start by importing the `@nadlowebagentur/audio-control` package in your desired file:

```typescript
import { AudioControl } from '@nadlowebagentur/audio-control';
```

### 2. Initialize the audio control

Next, initialize the audio control by calling the `AudioControl.initialize()` method:

```typescript
AudioControl.initialize();
```

### 3. Load an audio file

To load an audio file, use the `AudioControl.load()` method. Provide the URL of the audio file and any additional metadata (e.g., title, artist, album) as parameters:

```typescript
AudioControl.load({
  url: 'https://example.com/audio.mp3',
  title: 'Example Audio',
  artist: 'John Doe',
  album: 'Sample Album'
});
```

### 4. Play and pause the audio

To play the loaded audio file, use the `AudioControl.play()` method:

```typescript
AudioControl.play();
```

To pause the audio, use the `AudioControl.pause()` method:

```typescript
AudioControl.pause();
```

### 5. Handle audio events

You can listen to various audio events using the `AudioControl.addListeners()` method. This allows you to respond to changes in playback state, track changes, and more. Here's an example:

```typescript
AudioControl.addListeners({
  onPlaybackStateChanged: (state) => {
    console.log('Playback state changed:', state);
  },
  onTrackChanged: (track) => {
    console.log('Current track changed:', track);
  },
  // Add more event listeners as needed
});
```

### 6. Control the audio playback

The `@nadlowebagentur/audio-control` package provides methods for controlling the audio playback, such as skipping to the next or previous track, seeking to a specific position, and adjusting the volume. Here are some examples:

#### Skipping to the next track:

```typescript
AudioControl.skipToNextTrack();
```

#### Skipping to the previous track:

```typescript
AudioControl.skipToPreviousTrack();
```

#### Seeking to a specific position:

```typescript
AudioControl.seekToPosition(30); // Seek to 30 seconds in the current track
```

#### Adjusting the volume:

```typescript
AudioControl.setVolume(0.5); // Set the volume to 50%
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the `@nadlowebagentur/audio-control` package to control audio playback and manage playlists in a Capacitor project. We covered the installation process, initializing the audio control, loading audio files, playing and pausing the audio, handling audio events, and controlling the audio playback. With this package, you can easily add audio features to your Capacitor applications.
