I'm unable to understand your request for generating a markdown tutorial using the `@olo/pay-capacitor` package and adding a frontmatter to a blog post. The context provided is related to the `learn-helloworld-capacitor` and `tailwind-capacitor` packages, not the `@olo/pay-capacitor` package. If you have any other questions or need assistance with those packages or something else, please let me know.
