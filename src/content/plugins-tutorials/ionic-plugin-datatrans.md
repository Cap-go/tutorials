# Using cordova-plugin-datatrans package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to integrate and use the cordova-plugin-datatrans package in your Ionic app. The cordova-plugin-datatrans plugin provides a simple way to perform data transactions in your app using Cordova.

## Step 1: Install the Plugin

To get started, let's install the cordova-plugin-datatrans package. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your Ionic project directory. Run the following command to install the plugin:

```bash
ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-datatrans
```

This command will install the cordova-plugin-datatrans plugin to your project.

## Step 2: Configure the Plugin

Next, we need to configure the plugin to work with our app. Open the `config.xml` file in the root of your Ionic project. Locate the `<plugin>` tag and add the following code inside it:

```xml
<plugin name="cordova-plugin-datatrans" />
```

This will add the cordova-plugin-datatrans plugin to your app's configuration.

## Step 3: Use the Plugin in your Code

Now that the plugin is installed and configured, we can start using it in our code. Import the plugin in your TypeScript file by adding the following line at the top:

```typescript
import { cordova } from '@ionic-native/core';
import { DataTrans } from 'cordova-plugin-datatrans';
```

To perform a data transaction, you can use the `DataTrans` object provided by the plugin. Here's an example of how to initiate a data transaction:

```typescript
// Create a new instance of DataTrans
let dataTrans = new DataTrans();

// Perform a data transaction
dataTrans.performTransaction(data, successCallback, errorCallback);
```

In the above example, `data` represents the data you want to transfer, `successCallback` is the function to be called on a successful transaction, and `errorCallback` is the function to be called on an error.

## Step 4: Handle the Transaction Results

Once the transaction is completed or an error occurs, the corresponding callback functions will be called. Here's an example of how to handle the transaction results:

```typescript
// Success callback function
function successCallback(result) {
  console.log('Transaction successful:', result);
}

// Error callback function
function errorCallback(error) {
  console.error('Transaction failed:', error);
}
```

In the above example, the `successCallback` function will be called with the result of the transaction, while the `errorCallback` function will be called with the error message.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to integrate and use the cordova-plugin-datatrans package in your Ionic app. We installed the plugin, configured it, and used it to perform data transactions. You can now utilize the power of the cordova-plugin-datatrans plugin in your Ionic app to handle data transactions effectively.

Happy coding!
