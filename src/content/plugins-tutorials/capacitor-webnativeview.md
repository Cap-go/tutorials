# Using the capacitor-webnativeview Package

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the `capacitor-webnativeview` package to integrate web content within your Capacitor app. The `capacitor-webnativeview` package provides a WebView component that allows you to embed web content and interact with it seamlessly.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the `capacitor-webnativeview` package in your Capacitor app. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install capacitor-webnativeview
```

## Configuring Your Project

After installing the package, you need to configure your project to use the `capacitor-webnativeview` package. 

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, open your Xcode project and follow these steps:

1. Open your `Podfile` located in the `ios` directory.
2. Add the following line to your target section:

```ruby
pod 'CapacitorWebNativeView', :path => '../node_modules/capacitor-webnativeview'
```

3. Save the `Podfile` and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx cap update ios
```

### Android Configuration

For Android, open your `MainActivity.java` file located in the `android/app/src/main/java/<your-package-name>/` directory. Add the following import statement:

```java
import com.getcapacitor.community.webnativewebview.WebNativeCapacitor;
```

Then, add the following line inside the `init` method:

```java
add(WebNativeCapacitor.class);
```

## Using the WebNativeView Component

Now that your project is configured, you can start using the `WebNativeView` component to display web content within your app. 

1. Import the `WebNativeView` component at the top of your file:

```typescript
import { WebNativeView } from 'capacitor-webnativeview';
```

2. In your component's template, add the `WebNativeView` component:

```html
<web-native-view></web-native-view>
```

3. Customize the `WebNativeView` component by adding attributes to the element. For example, you can set the URL of the web content to be loaded:

```html
<web-native-view src="https://example.com"></web-native-view>
```

4. You can also listen to events emitted by the `WebNativeView` component. For example, to handle the `loadstart` event:

```html
<web-native-view (loadstart)="onLoadStart($event)"></web-native-view>
```

5. In your component's TypeScript file, implement the event handler:

```typescript
onLoadStart(event: CustomEvent<InAppBrowserEvent>) {
  const url = event.detail.url;
  // Handle the event
}
```

## Additional Features

The `capacitor-webnativeview` package provides additional features and methods to enhance your web content integration. Some of these features include:

- Customizing the appearance and behavior of the WebNativeView component.
- Interacting with the web content using JavaScript APIs.
- Handling various events emitted by the WebNativeView component.

Please refer to the official documentation of the `capacitor-webnativeview` package for more details on these features and their usage.
