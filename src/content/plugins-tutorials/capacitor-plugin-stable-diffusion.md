# Using capacitor-plugin-stable-diffusion

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `capacitor-plugin-stable-diffusion` package to enhance the stability of your Capacitor app.

## Installation

First, make sure you have Capacitor installed globally on your machine. If not, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @capacitor/cli
```

Next, add the `capacitor-plugin-stable-diffusion` package to your project:

```bash
npm install capacitor-plugin-stable-diffusion
```

## Setup

Once the package is installed, we need to integrate it with our Capacitor app. Follow these steps:

1. Open your Capacitor app project folder.
2. Locate the `capacitor.config.json` file.
3. Add the following entry to the "plugins" section:

```json
{
  "name": "StableDiffusion",
  "class": "io.ionic.capacitor.plugins.StableDiffusion"
}
```

## Usage

After setting up the plugin, you can use its features in your app. Here are some examples:

### Tracking Events

You can track events in your app using the `trackEvent` method. This method allows you to record user interactions, errors, or any other custom event you want to monitor.

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { StableDiffusion } = Plugins;

async function trackEvent(eventName: string, eventData: any) {
  await StableDiffusion.trackEvent({
    name: eventName,
    data: eventData
  });
}
```

### Logging Errors

The `logError` method allows you to log errors and exceptions in your app. By logging errors, you can identify and fix issues that may cause the app to crash or behave unexpectedly.

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { StableDiffusion } = Plugins;

try {
  // Code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  StableDiffusion.logError(error);
}
```

### Monitoring Usage

You can monitor the usage of different features in your app using the `monitorUsage` method. This allows you to gather data on user interactions and analyze how users engage with your app.

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { StableDiffusion } = Plugins;

function onButtonClick() {
  StableDiffusion.monitorUsage('button_click');
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to use the `capacitor-plugin-stable-diffusion` package to enhance the stability of our Capacitor app. We explored how to track events, log errors, and monitor app usage. By leveraging these capabilities, you can improve the reliability and user experience of your app.

Give the `capacitor-plugin-stable-diffusion` package a try and see how it can help make your app more stable and robust. Happy coding!
