# Using pdtworki-google-drive Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the pdtworki-google-drive package to integrate Google Drive functionality into your application. With this package, you will be able to perform various operations such as uploading, downloading, and managing files on Google Drive.

## Step 1: Install the Package

First, you need to install the pdtworki-google-drive package using npm. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install pdtworki-google-drive
```

## Step 2: Set Up Google Drive API Credentials

To use the Google Drive API, you need to set up API credentials on the Google Cloud Platform. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

2. Create a new project or select an existing project.

3. Enable the Google Drive API by searching for "Google Drive API" in the search bar and clicking on the "Enable" button.

4. Go to the "Credentials" section and click on "Create credentials".

5. Select "OAuth client ID" as the credential type.

6. Configure the OAuth consent screen by providing a name and authorized domains.

7. Choose "Web application" as the application type.

8. Enter a name for the OAuth client ID and specify the authorized JavaScript origins and redirect URIs.

9. Click on the "Create" button to generate the OAuth client ID.

10. Take note of the generated client ID and client secret.

## Step 3: Set Up Authorization

Next, you need to set up authorization to access Google Drive using the generated client ID and client secret. Follow these steps:

1. Initialize the pdtworki-google-drive package in your application:

   ```javascript
   const drive = require("pdtworki-google-drive");
   const auth = new drive.auth.OAuth2Client({
     clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
     clientSecret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
     redirectUri: "YOUR_REDIRECT_URI",
   });
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `YOUR_REDIRECT_URI` with your actual credentials.

2. Generate an authorization URL:

   ```javascript
   const authUrl = auth.generateAuthUrl({
     scope: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive",
   });
   ```

3. Redirect the user to the authorization URL. Once the user grants authorization, they will be redirected back to the specified redirect URI with an authorization code.

4. Exchange the authorization code for an access token:

   ```javascript
   const code = "AUTHORIZATION_CODE";
   const { tokens } = await auth.getToken(code);
   auth.setCredentials(tokens);
   ```

   Replace `AUTHORIZATION_CODE` with the actual authorization code obtained from the redirect URI.

5. You are now authorized to access the Google Drive API.

## Step 4: Perform Operations on Google Drive

Now that you have set up the authorization, you can start performing operations on Google Drive. Here are a few examples:

### Upload a File

To upload a file to Google Drive, use the following code:

```javascript
const { data } = await drive.files.create({
  requestBody: {
    name: "example.txt",
    mimeType: "text/plain",
    parents: ["FOLDER_ID"], // Replace FOLDER_ID with the ID of the folder where you want to upload the file
  },
  media: {
    mimeType: "text/plain",
    body: fs.createReadStream("/path/to/example.txt"), // Replace /path/to/example.txt with the actual path to your file
  },
});
```

### Download a File

To download a file from Google Drive, use the following code:

```javascript
const fileId = "FILE_ID"; // Replace FILE_ID with the ID of the file you want to download
const { data } = await drive.files.get({
  fileId,
  alt: "media",
}, { responseType: "stream" });

const dest = fs.createWriteStream("/path/to/destination.txt"); // Replace /path/to/destination.txt with the desired destination path
data.pipe(dest);
```

### List Files

To list files on Google Drive, use the following code:

```javascript
const { data } = await drive.files.list({
  pageSize: 10,
  fields: "nextPageToken, files(id, name)",
});
const files = data.files;
files.forEach((file) => {
  console.log(`File Name: ${file.name}, File ID: ${file.id}`);
});
```

These are just a few examples of what you can do with the pdtworki-google-drive package. Refer to the package documentation for more details on available methods and options.
