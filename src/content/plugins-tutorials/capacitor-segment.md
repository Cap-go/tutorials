# Using the @joinflux/capacitor-segment Package

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the `@joinflux/capacitor-segment` package in a Capacitor app. The `@joinflux/capacitor-segment` package allows you to integrate the Segment analytics platform into your Capacitor app.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- Capacitor CLI installed globally (`npm install -g @capacitor/cli`)
- A Capacitor project set up (`npx @capacitor/cli create`)

## Installation

To start using the `@joinflux/capacitor-segment` package, follow these steps:

1. In your Capacitor project, open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the package using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @joinflux/capacitor-segment
```

or

```bash
yarn add @joinflux/capacitor-segment
```

3. Sync the native project with Capacitor:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

## Configuration

Next, we need to configure the `@joinflux/capacitor-segment` package with your Segment write key. 

1. Open the `capacitor.config.json` file in your Capacitor project.
2. Add the following configuration to the `"plugins"` section:

```json
"SegmentPlugin": {
  "writeKey": "YOUR_SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY"
}
```

Replace `YOUR_SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY` with your actual Segment write key.

## Usage

With the `@joinflux/capacitor-segment` package installed and configured, we can now start using it in our Capacitor app.

1. Import the `SegmentPlugin` from the package:

```javascript
import { SegmentPlugin } from '@joinflux/capacitor-segment';
```

2. Initialize the Segment plugin with your Segment write key in your app's entry point (e.g., `src/main.ts`):

```javascript
import { Capacitor } from '@capacitor/core';

// ...

if (Capacitor.isNativePlatform()) {
  SegmentPlugin.initialize({
    writeKey: 'YOUR_SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY'
  });
}
```

Replace `YOUR_SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY` with your actual Segment write key.

3. Track events in your app using the `track` method:

```javascript
SegmentPlugin.track('Button Clicked', { buttonId: 'my-button' });
```

Replace `'Button Clicked'` with the name of the event you want to track, and `{ buttonId: 'my-button' }` with any additional properties relevant to the event.

4. Identify users using the `identify` method:

```javascript
SegmentPlugin.identify({ userId: '12345', traits: { name: 'John Doe' } });
```

Replace `'12345'` with the unique user ID and `{ name: 'John Doe' }` with any traits you want to associate with the user.

5. Use other methods provided by the `SegmentPlugin` as needed, such as `screen` for tracking screen views and `alias` for aliasing user identities.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we went through the process of installing, configuring, and using the `@joinflux/capacitor-segment` package in a Capacitor app. We learned how to track events, identify users, and use other available methods provided by the package.

With the `@joinflux/capacitor-segment` package, you can easily integrate Segment analytics into your Capacitor app and gain insights into user behavior and app performance.

Remember to consult the official documentation of the `@joinflux/capacitor-segment` package for more information and advanced usage options. Happy coding!
