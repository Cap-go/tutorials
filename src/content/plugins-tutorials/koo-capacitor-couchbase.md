# Tutorial: Using koo-capacitor-couchbase Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to integrate Couchbase in a Capacitor project using the koo-capacitor-couchbase package.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- Capacitor installed globally
- A Capacitor project set up

## Installation
To use the koo-capacitor-couchbase package, you need to install it in your Capacitor project. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory. Then, run the following command:

```shell
npm install koo-capacitor-couchbase
```

This will install the package and its dependencies in your project.

## Usage
After installing the package, you can import and use it in your code. Follow these steps to integrate Couchbase using the koo-capacitor-couchbase package:

1. Import the package in your JavaScript/TypeScript file:

```javascript
import { PluginRegistry } from '@capacitor/core';
import { CouchbasePlugin } from 'koo-capacitor-couchbase';

const registry = new PluginRegistry();
registry.registerPlugin('CouchbasePlugin', CouchbasePlugin);
```

2. Initialize Couchbase and create a database instance:

```javascript
const couchbase = Capacitor.Plugins.CouchbasePlugin;

const database = await couchbase.createDatabase('myDatabase');
```

3. Perform database operations, such as creating or retrieving documents:

```javascript
const document = {
  _id: 'document-1',
  title: 'My Document',
  content: 'This is a sample document.',
};

await database.createDocument(document);

const retrievedDocument = await database.getDocument('document-1');
console.log(retrievedDocument);
```

4. When you're done using the database, close the connection:

```javascript
await couchbase.closeDatabase('myDatabase');
```

That's it! Now you can integrate Couchbase in your Capacitor project using the koo-capacitor-couchbase package.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we covered the installation and usage of the koo-capacitor-couchbase package. You learned how to import the package, create a database instance, perform database operations, and close the connection. With this knowledge, you can effectively use Couchbase in your Capacitor projects.
