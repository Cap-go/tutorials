# Using @mrwinston/capacitor-native-print Package

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `@mrwinston/capacitor-native-print` package in a Capacitor application. This package allows us to print documents and images from our app using native printing capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

- Capacitor installed and configured in your project
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Capacitor concepts

## Installation

To install the `@mrwinston/capacitor-native-print` package, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install @mrwinston/capacitor-native-print
```

## Configuration

Once the package is installed, we need to configure it in our Capacitor project. Open the `capacitor.config.json` file and add the following configuration under the `plugins` section:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "NativePrint": {
      "someConfig": "value"
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace `"someConfig": "value"` with the actual configuration for the `@mrwinston/capacitor-native-print` package.

## Usage

Now that the package is installed and configured, we can use its functionality in our app. Here's an example of how to print a document:

```javascript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { NativePrint } = Plugins;

const printDocument = async (documentUrl) => {
  try {
    const result = await NativePrint.print({
      url: documentUrl
    });
    console.log('Print Result:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Print Error:', error);
  }
};

printDocument('https://example.com/document.pdf');
```

In this example, we import the `NativePrint` plugin from the `@capacitor/core` package. We then define a function `printDocument` that takes a document URL as input and uses the `print` method of the `NativePrint` plugin to initiate the printing process. The result of the print operation is logged to the console.

You can customize the printing options by passing additional parameters to the `print` method. Refer to the package documentation for more information on available options.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to install, configure, and use the `@mrwinston/capacitor-native-print` package in a Capacitor application. We explored the basic usage of the package and saw how to print documents. You can now integrate native printing capabilities into your app with ease.
