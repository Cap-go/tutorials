# Using the Yagnik Scanner Package
The Yagnik Scanner package is a powerful tool that allows you to easily integrate barcode scanning functionality into your Capacitor project. With this package, you can quickly and accurately scan different types of barcodes such as QR codes and UPC codes.

## Installation
To get started with the Yagnik Scanner package, follow these steps:

1. Install the package using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @yagnik-solutions/scanner
```
or
```bash
yarn add @yagnik-solutions/scanner

## Scanning Barcodes
Once you have installed and imported the package, you can start scanning barcodes using the following steps:

1. Request camera permission:

```

2. Start the scanner:

```javascript
await scanner.startScanner();
```

3. Listen for barcode scan events:

```javascript
scanner.onBarcodeScan(result => {
  // Handle the scanned barcode result
  console.log(result);
});
```

4. Stop the scanner when you are done:

```javascript
await scanner.stopScanner();
```

## Error Handling
In case of any errors during the scanning process, you can handle them using try-catch blocks:

```javascript
try {
  // Start the scanner
  await scanner.startScanner();
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the error
  console.error('Scanner error:', error);
}
```
