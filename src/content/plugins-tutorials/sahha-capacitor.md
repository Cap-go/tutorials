# Using the Sahha Capacitor Package

In this tutorial, we will explore the Sahha Capacitor package and learn how to use it to build mobile apps. Capacitor is a cross-platform app development framework that allows you to build web apps that can be deployed as native apps on iOS, Android, and other platforms.

## Installation

To start using Sahha Capacitor, you need to install it in your project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install sahha-capacitor
```

This will install the Sahha Capacitor package and add it as a dependency in your project's `package.json` file.

## Initializing Capacitor

After installing Sahha Capacitor, you need to initialize Capacitor in your project. Navigate to the root directory of your project in the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx cap init
```

This command will create the necessary configuration files and folders for Capacitor in your project.

## Adding Platforms

Next, we need to add the platforms on which we want to build our app. Capacitor supports multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and others. To add a platform, run the following command:

```bash
npx cap add ios
```

Replace `ios` with the platform name you want to add. Repeat this command for each platform you want to add.

## Creating a Capacitor Plugin

Sahha Capacitor also provides the capability to create custom plugins. To create a Capacitor plugin with Sahha, run the following command:

```bash
npx sahha create-plugin
```

Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information to generate the plugin. The generated plugin will have the basic structure and files required for a Capacitor plugin.

## Building and Running the App

Once you have added the platforms and created any necessary plugins, you can build and run your app. To build the app, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will build the web app and generate the necessary output files. To open the app in a specific platform emulator or device, run the command:

```bash
npx cap open <platform>
```

Replace `<platform>` with the platform name you want to open the app in. This will open the app in the specified platform emulator or device.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have explored the Sahha Capacitor package and learned how to use it to build mobile apps. We have covered the installation process, initializing Capacitor, adding platforms, creating Capacitor plugins, and building and running the app. Capacitor provides a powerful set of tools and features for building cross-platform mobile apps, and Sahha Capacitor extends its capabilities further.

Now you are ready to start using the Sahha Capacitor package in your own projects. Happy coding!
