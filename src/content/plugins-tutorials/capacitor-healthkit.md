# Using @perfood/capacitor-healthkit Package

In this tutorial, we will explore how to leverage the capabilities of the @perfood/capacitor-healthkit package to seamlessly integrate HealthKit functionality into Capacitor-based iOS applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Xcode (with iOS simulator or physical device)
- Capacitor CLI (if you haven't installed it already, run `npm install -g @capacitor/cli`)

## Step 1: Install the Package

To get started, let's install the @perfood/capacitor-healthkit package in our Capacitor project. Open a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install @perfood/capacitor-healthkit
```

## Step 2: Set Up HealthKit Permissions

In order to access HealthKit data, we need to request appropriate user permissions. Open your `ios/App/App/AppDelegate.swift` file and add the following code inside the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method:

```swift
import CapacitorHealthKit

// ...

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // ...
    if let bridge = bridge {
        CapacitorHealthKit.register(bridge: bridge)
    }
    // ...
    return true
}
```

## Step 3: Define HealthKit Data Types

Next, we need to define the HealthKit data types that our application will access. Open your `ios/App/App/Plugin.swift` file and add the following code:

```swift
import Capacitor
import CapacitorHealthKit

@objc(HealthKitPlugin)
public class HealthKitPlugin: CAPPlugin {
    
    @objc func getHealthData(_ call: CAPPluginCall) {
        // Your code to retrieve HealthKit data here...
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

## Step 4: Implement HealthKit Functionality

Now it's time to implement specific functionality using the @perfood/capacitor-healthkit package. In the `getHealthData()` method of your plugin file, you can use the various APIs provided by the package to query and retrieve HealthKit data.

Here's an example to get the user's step count for a specific date range:

```swift
// Inside getHealthData() method

let query = HKStatisticsCollectionQuery(quantityType: HKQuantityType.quantityType(forIdentifier: .stepCount)!, quantitySamplePredicate: predicate, options: [.cumulativeSum], anchorDate: startDate, intervalComponents: interval)

query.initialResultsHandler = { query, results, error in
    // Handle the query results here...
}

healthStore.execute(query)
```

## Step 5: Build and Run Your App

Once you have implemented the desired HealthKit functionality, it's time to build and run your Capacitor app. Use the following command to build your project:

```bash
npx cap build ios
```

After a successful build, open Xcode and run the app on an iOS simulator or a physical device.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have learned how to use the @perfood/capacitor-healthkit package to integrate HealthKit functionality into your Capacitor-based iOS application. You can now retrieve and utilize various HealthKit data types to create powerful and health-oriented features in your app.

Remember to refer to the official documentation of the @perfood/capacitor-healthkit package for a comprehensive understanding of all the available APIs and functionalities.

Happy coding!
