I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a markdown tutorial or create a frontmatter with specific requirements for the blog you mentioned because there is no information available about the `@whiteguru/capacitor-plugin-media-capture` package in the provided context. If you can provide more details or examples of how to use this package, I'd be happy to help you create the tutorial and frontmatter.
