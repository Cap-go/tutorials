# Tutorial: Using @paystory/capacitor-headwind-mdm Package

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `@paystory/capacitor-headwind-mdm` package to integrate Headwind MDM (Mobile Device Management) functionality into your Capacitor app. 

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, please make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- Capacitor CLI
- A Capacitor project set up

## Step 1: Install the Package

First, let's install the `@paystory/capacitor-headwind-mdm` package. Open your terminal and navigate to your Capacitor project directory. Then, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @paystory/capacitor-headwind-mdm
```

This will install the package and its dependencies into your project.

## Step 2: Configure the Package

Next, we need to configure the package to work with your Headwind MDM provider. Open your `capacitor.config.json` file and add the following configuration:

```json
"plugins": {
  "@paystory/capacitor-headwind-mdm": {
    "provider": "YOUR_PROVIDER_NAME",
    "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_PROVIDER_NAME` with the name of your Headwind MDM provider, and `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key provided by the provider.

## Step 3: Use the Package

Now that the package is installed and configured, you can start using its functionality in your app. Here are some examples of what you can do with the package:

- Push notifications: Send push notifications to devices registered with your Headwind MDM provider.
- Device management: Get information about devices, update device settings, and perform actions on devices remotely.

To use these features, you can import the package into your code and call its methods. Here's an example of how to send a push notification using the package:

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';

const { HeadwindMdm } = Plugins;

HeadwindMdm.sendPushNotification({
  title: 'New Message',
  body: 'You have a new message!',
}).then(() => {
  console.log('Push notification sent successfully');
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error sending push notification:', error);
});
```

Feel free to explore the package's documentation for more details on its features and methods.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to integrate Headwind MDM functionality into your Capacitor app using the `@paystory/capacitor-headwind-mdm` package. We covered the installation process, configuration steps, and examples of how to use the package's features.

Now you can leverage the power of Headwind MDM to manage and control your mobile devices with ease. Happy coding!
