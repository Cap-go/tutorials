## Tutorial: Using @varsitysoftware/capacitor-plugin-read-key Package

### Introduction
In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `@varsitysoftware/capacitor-plugin-read-key` package with Capacitor to read a specific key value from a file. This can be useful when you need to securely store sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, or other confidential data.

### Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Capacitor: `npm install --save @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli`
- @varsitysoftware/capacitor-plugin-read-key: `npm install --save @varsitysoftware/capacitor-plugin-read-key`

### Step 1: Installation
To start using the `@varsitysoftware/capacitor-plugin-read-key` package, install it via npm:
```bash
npm install --save @varsitysoftware/capacitor-plugin-read-key
```

### Step 2: Import the Plugin
In your project's main entry file, import the plugin using Capacitor's `Plugins` API:
```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
const { ReadKeyPlugin } = Plugins;
```

### Step 3: Read the Key Value
Now, you can use the `readKey` method provided by the `ReadKeyPlugin` to read the value associated with a specific key in your file. For example:
```typescript
const result = await ReadKeyPlugin.readKey({ key: 'API_KEY' });
console.log(result.value);
```

Make sure to replace `'API_KEY'` with the actual name of your key.

### Step 4: Error Handling
In case of any errors during the key reading process, the `result` object will contain an `error` property that you can check. Here's an example of how you can handle errors:
```typescript
if (result.error) {
  console.error('Failed to read key:', result.error);
} else {
  console.log('Key value:', result.value);
}
```

### Step 5: Cleaning Up
When you're done using the plugin, it's good practice to detach the plugin event listeners and clean up any resources. You can do this by calling the `removeAllListeners` method:
```typescript
ReadKeyPlugin.removeAllListeners();
```

That's it! You have successfully learned how to use the `@varsitysoftware/capacitor-plugin-read-key` package to read a specific key value from a file using Capacitor.
