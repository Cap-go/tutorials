# Using capacitor-plugin-playlist

In this tutorial, we will go through the steps to use the capacitor-plugin-playlist package for managing audio playlists in Capacitor. This package provides native support for audio playlists, background playback, and lock screen controls on Android, iOS, and web platforms.

## Installation

To install the capacitor-plugin-playlist package, follow these steps:

1. Open your project directory in the terminal.
2. Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
npm install capacitor-plugin-playlist
```

3. After the installation is complete, synchronize the capacitor project using the following command:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

## Usage

1. Import the capacitor-plugin-playlist package in your component:
   
   ```typescript
   import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
   const { PlaylistPlugin } = Plugins;
   ```

2. Use the `PlaylistPlugin` methods to manage audio playlists.

   For example, to play a specific audio track from a playlist, use the `play` method:

   ```typescript
   async function playAudioTrack(trackIndex: number) {
     try {
       await PlaylistPlugin.play({
         index: trackIndex
       });
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error playing audio track:', error);
     }
   }
   ```

   You can also use other methods provided by the plugin like `pause`, `resume`, `skipToNext`, `skipToPrevious`, etc. to control the audio playback.

3. Customize the audio playlist and manage events.

   The capacitor-plugin-playlist package provides methods to add tracks to the playlist, remove tracks, clear the entire playlist, and handle events like track changes.

   ```typescript
   // Add a track to the playlist
   await PlaylistPlugin.addTrack({
     title: 'My Song',
     artist: 'John Doe',
     url: 'https://example.com/audio.mp3'
   });

   // Remove a track from the playlist
   await PlaylistPlugin.removeTrack({ index: 0 });

   // Clear the entire playlist
   await PlaylistPlugin.clearPlaylist();

   // Subscribe to track change events
   PlaylistPlugin.addListener('onTrackChanged', (event) => {
     console.log('Track changed:', event);
   });
   ```

   You can also use the event listener to update the UI or perform other actions when the track changes.
