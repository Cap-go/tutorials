I'm unable to provide the specific tutorial content for using the `@ua/capacitor-airship` package as I don't have access to the details of this package. However, I can help you format the frontmatter portion of your markdown file with the required values. Here's an example of how the markdown file would look like with the frontmatter included:

```markdown
---
"title": "Your Blog Title"
"description": "Summary of what will be in the blog"
"created_at": "2022-01-01"
"published": true
"slug": "capacitor-airship.git"
---

# Using @ua/capacitor-airship Package

<!-- Add your tutorial content here -->
```

You can fill in the tutorial content under the appropriate section in the markdown file.
